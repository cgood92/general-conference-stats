        <p data-aid="149807935" id="p1">I have a dear friend who is a
            brilliant, retired university professor, a prolific author, and,
            above all, a committed disciple of Jesus Christ. He has visited
            the Holy Land dozens of times to participate in conferences,
            conduct academic research, and lead tours. According to him,
            every time he visits the land where Jesus walked, he marvels
            because he undoubtedly learns something new, astonishing, and
            fascinating about the Savior, His mortal ministry, and His
            beloved homeland. The awe my friend shows when he talks about
            all that he learns in the Holy Land is contagious, and this
            amazement has been fundamental in his great achievements and
            academic pursuits in his life.</p>
        <p data-aid="149807942" id="p2">As I have listened to his
            experiences and felt of his enthusiasm, I have reflected on how
            much more spiritual wonder, so to speak, that we can and should
            feel for the gospel of Jesus Christ and the difference it can
            make in our discipleship and in our journey toward eternal life.
            The wonder I refer to is the sensation of emotion, awe, or
            amazement common to all who wholeheartedly center their lives on
            the Savior and His teachings and humbly recognize His presence
            in their lives. Such a feeling of wonder, inspired by the
            influence of the Holy Ghost, stimulates the enthusiasm to
            joyfully live the doctrine of Christ.<a class="note-ref"

        <p data-aid="149807949" id="p3">The scriptures contain several
            examples of how this sensation is manifest. The prophet Isaiah,
            for example, expressed the depth of his gratitude for the Lord
            through his rejoicing in Him.<a class="note-ref"

            truly are in awe of Jesus Christ and His gospel, we are happier,
            we have more enthusiasm for God’s work, and we recognize the
            Lord’s hand in all things. Additionally, our study of God’s
            words is more meaningful; our prayers, more intentional; our
            worship, more reverent; our service in God’s kingdom, more
            diligent. All these actions contribute to the Holy Spirit’s
            influence being more frequent in our lives.<a class="note-ref"

        <p data-aid="149807963" id="p5">Such apathy is characterized by the
            gradual loss of our excitement to engage fully in the Lord’s
            gospel. It generally begins when we are feeling that we have
            already attained all the necessary knowledge and blessings for
            our happiness in this life. This complacency, so to speak,
            causes us to take the gospel gifts for granted, and from then
            on, we run the risk of neglecting both our regular immersion in
            the essentials of the gospel of Jesus Christ<a class="note-ref"

            work. Doubt regarding the truths we have already received may

            Wasn’t this exactly what happened to the people of Nephi shortly

            all which they had heard and seen.” Thus did Satan “blind their

            Wes and who is attending the conference today, accepted Christ’s
            invitation to learn of Him and of His gospel and began to
            experience the awe of His love after 27 years of distancing
            himself from the covenant path. He told me that one day he was
            contacted via Facebook by a missionary, Elder Jones, who was
            temporarily assigned to Wes’s area before going to his
            originally assigned mission in Panama. When Elder Jones came
            across Wes’s profile, not even knowing beforehand that he was
            already a member of the Church, he felt the guidance of the Holy
            Ghost and knew that he should immediately contact Wes. He
            quickly acted on this impression. Wes was amazed by this
            unexpected contact and began to realize that the Lord was aware
            of him despite his distance from the covenant path.</p>
        <p data-aid="149807996" id="p16">From then on, Wes and the
            missionaries began to communicate frequently. Elder Jones and
            his companion provided weekly acts of service and spiritual
            messages that helped Wes to recover his awe of the Savior and
            His gospel. It rekindled the flame of his testimony of the truth
            and of the Savior’s love for him. Wes felt the peace that comes
            from the Comforter and gained the strength he needed to return
            to the fold. He told me that this experience brought him
            spiritually and emotionally back to life and helped him to
            eliminate the feelings of bitterness accumulated over the years
            because of the difficult experiences he had been through.</p>

            pray that we will ever stand in awe of Jesus Christ and His
            complete, infinite, and perfect love. May the remembrance of
            what our eyes have seen and our hearts have felt increase our
            amazement at the Savior’s atoning sacrifice, which can heal us
            of our spiritual and emotional wounds and help us to draw closer
            to Him. May we marvel at the great promises that the Father has
            in His hands and that He has prepared for those who are
            faithful:</p>
