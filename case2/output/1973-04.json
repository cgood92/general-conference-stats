        "content": "It is a great delight to meet here today, and to those who may be listening from far and near, we assure you that we welcome you likewise.\nThis is the annual conference of the Church. April 6, 1973, is a particularly significant date because it commemorates not only the anniversary of the organization of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in this dispensation, but also the anniversary of the birth of the Savior, our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ. Joseph Smith wrote this, preceding a revelation given at that same date:\n“The rise of the Church of Christ in these last days, being one thousand eight hundred and thirty years since the coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in the flesh, it being regularly organized and established agreeable to the laws of our country, by the will and commandments of God, in the fourth month, and on the sixth day of the month which is called April.” (D&C 20:1.)\nTraditionally since that time, the spring conferences of the Church are held on the days of each year which include April 6.\nTwo years later another revelation followed, which had great significance then, and today has even greater meaning as viewed in the light of the demands of the increasing membership in the Church. This is a quotation which may be something of a text for my next few remarks today:\n“For Zion must increase in beauty, and in holiness; her borders must be enlarged; her stakes must be strengthened; yea, verily I say unto you, Zion must arise and put on her beautiful garments.” (D&C 82:14.)\nZion, as used here, undoubtedly had reference to the Church. At that time there was but a small body of Church members just beginning to emerge as an organization, after having experienced harsh treatment from enemies outside the Church, who had then been directed to gather together in Jackson County, Missouri, which the Lord had designated as the “land of Zion.”\nAs though to impress upon these early struggling members their destiny in the world, the Lord in another revelation told them this:\n“Therefore, verily, thus saith the Lord, let Zion rejoice, for this is Zion—the pure in heart; therefore, let Zion rejoice, while all the wicked shall mourn.” (D&C 97:21.)\nTo be worthy of such a sacred designation as Zion, the Church must think of itself as a bride adorned for her husband, as John the Revelator recorded when he saw in vision the Holy City where the righteous dwelled, adorned as a bride for the Lamb of God as her husband. Here is portrayed the relationship the Lord desires in his people in order to be acceptable to our Lord and Master even as a wife would adorn herself in beautiful garments for her husband.\nThe rule by which the people of God must live in order to be worthy of acceptance in the sight of God is indicated by the text to which I have made reference. This people must increase in beauty before the world; have an inward loveliness which may be observed by mankind as a reflection in holiness and in those inherent qualities of sanctity. The borders of Zion, where the righteous and pure in heart may dwell, must now begin to be enlarged. The stakes of Zion must be strengthened. All this so that Zion may arise and shine by becoming increasingly diligent in carrying out the plan of salvation throughout the world.\nWhile the Church was in its infancy, the Lord pointed to a time when those earlier gathering places would not have room for all who would be gathered for reasons for which he declared that his church should be united. Here are his words:\n“For thus shall my church be called in the last days, even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.” And then this command: “Arise and shine forth, that thy light may be a standard for the nations.” (D&C 115:4–5.)\nHere is clearly inferred that the coming forth of his church in these days was the beginning of the fulfillment of the ancient prophecy when “the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths. …” (Isa. 2:2–3.)\nIn these revelations the Lord speaks of organized units of the Church which are designated as stakes, each of which those not of our faith may think of as a diocese. These units so organized are gathered together for these fundamental purposes: first, for a defense against the enemies of the Lord’s work, both the seen and the unseen.\nThe apostle Paul said with reference to these enemies about which we should be concerned:\n“For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.” (Eph. 6:12.)\nThese organizations were to be as stated in the revelation noted earlier, as a “refuge from the storm, and from wrath when it shall be poured out without mixture upon the whole earth.” (D&C 115:6.)\nIn the preface to all the Lord’s revelations that he gave from the beginning of this dispensation, he issued this fateful warning, which must never be absent from our minds. This prophetic warning of 1831 was given, as the Lord declared, so that “all men shall know that the day speedily cometh; the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand, when peace shall be taken from the earth, and the devil shall have power over his own dominion.” (D&C 1:35.)\nNow 142 years later we are witnessing the fury of this time, when Satan has power over his own dominion, with such might that even the Master in his day referred to him as the “prince of this world,” the “enemy of all righteousness.”\nDespite these dire predictions and the evidences of their fulfillment truly before us today, there is promised in this same revelation even a greater power to thwart Satan’s plans to destroy the work of the Lord. Here the Lord makes this promise to the Saints of the Most High God, to the righteous in heart to whom he has referred as “the people of Zion.” This is what he said:\n“And also the Lord shall have power over his saints, and shall reign in their midst, and shall come down in judgment upon Idumea, or the world.” (D&C 1:36.)\nThis has reference to the world in the same sense as when the Master spoke of the worldliness from which he warned his disciples, that while they would be engulfed in the world, they must keep themselves from the sins to be found therein.\nI believe there has never been a time since the creation that the Lord has left the dominion of the devil to destroy his work without his power being manifest in the midst of the righteous to save the works of righteousness from being completely overthrown.\nToday we are witnessing the promise of the Lord that “if your eye be single to my glory,” which he declared to the prophet Moses was “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39), “your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things.” (D&C 88:67.)\nWe have also been promised by the Lord: “Behold, and lo, I will take care of your flocks, and will raise up elders and send unto them. Behold, I will hasten my work in its time.” (D&C 88:72–73.)\nToday we are witnessing the demonstration of the Lord’s hand even in the midst of his saints, the members of the Church. Never in this dispensation, and perhaps never before in any single period, has there been such a feeling of urgency among the members of this church as today. Her boundaries are being enlarged, her stakes are being strengthened. In the early years of the Church specific places to which the Saints were to be gathered together were given, and the Lord directed that these gathering places should not be changed, but then he gave one qualification: “Until the day cometh when there is found no more room for them; and then I have other places which I will appoint unto them, and they shall be called stakes, for the curtains or the strength of Zion.” (D&C 101:21.)\nAt the Mexico City Area Conference last August, Elder Bruce R. McConkie of the Council of the Twelve, in a thought-provoking address, made some comments pertinent to this subject, and I quote a few sentences from his address:\n“Of this glorious day of restoration and gathering, another Nephite prophet said: ‘The Lord … has covenanted with all the house of Israel,’ that ‘the time comes that they shall be restored to the true church and fold of God’; and that ‘they shall be gathered home to the lands of their inheritance, and shall be established in all their lands of promise.’ (2 Ne. 9:1–2.)\n“Now I call your attention to the facts, set forth in these scriptures, that the gathering of Israel consists of joining the true church; of coming to a knowledge of the true God and of his saving truths; and of worshiping him in the congregations of the Saints in all nations and among all peoples. Please note that these revealed words speak of the folds of the Lord; of Israel being gathered to the lands of their inheritance; of Israel being established in all their lands of promise; and of there being congregations of the covenant people of the Lord in every nation, speaking every tongue, and among every people when the Lord comes again.”\nElder McConkie then concluded with this statement, which certainly emphasizes the great need for the teaching and training of local leadership in order to build up the church within their own native countries:\n“The place of gathering for the Mexican Saints is in Mexico; the place of gathering for the Guatemalan Saints is in Guatemala; the place of gathering for the Brazilian Saints is in Brazil; and so it goes throughout the length and breadth of the whole earth. Japan is for the Japanese; Korea is for the Koreans; Australia is for the Australians; every nation is the gathering place for its own people.”\nThe most frequently asked question from inquirers is, “How do you account for the phenomenal growth of this church when so many others are on the decline?”\nAmong the primary and many factors which account for the continued growth of the Church, I will mention only a few, for those who would ask this question to ponder.\nNo longer might this church be thought of as the “Utah church,” or as an “American church,” but the membership of the Church is now distributed over the earth in 78 countries, teaching the gospel in 17 different languages at the present time.\nThis greatly expanded church population is today our most challenging problem, and while we have cause for much rejoicing in such a widespread expansion, it does pose some great challenges to the leadership of the Church to keep pace with the many problems.\nTwo basic principles have always guided the leaders of the Church in their planning to meet these circumstances. The first that might be called to the attention of those who would be interested is the basic principle of the plan of salvation from before the foundation of the world, for the redemption of mankind and which has been revealed to the prophets of this dispensation and has not been changed, for as the apostle Paul declared in his day, so do we declare today:\n“But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. …\n“But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.\n“For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.” (Gal. 1:8, 11–12.)\nIf we were to answer those who ask us why the steady growth, we would answer that the first fundamental reason would be that we have held our course in teaching the fundamental doctrines of the Church. We declare in one of our Articles of Faith:\n“We believe [and, we might add, teach] all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.” (A of F 1:9.)\nIn one of the latest of the Lord’s revelations in this dispensation, he gave the reason for the confusion among the many churches then in existence: because they have, as he said, “strayed from mine ordinances, and have broken mine everlasting covenant; They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own God, whose image is in the likeness of the world. …” (D&C 1:15–16.)\nTherefore a new restoration was necessary, as he plainly declared:\n“Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments;\n“And also gave commandments to others, that they should proclaim these things unto the world; and all this that it might be fulfilled, which was written by the prophets. …\n“But that every man might speak in the name of God the Lord, even the Savior of the world; …\n“That the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world, and before kings and rulers.\n“… after the manner of their language, that they might come to understanding.” (D&C 1:17–18, 20, 23–24.)\nThere are those who speak of an ecumenical movement, where theoretically, it is supposed, all churches would be brought together into a universal organization. In essence it probably would contemplate that they would give up their basic principles and be united in a nebulous organization which would not necessarily be founded on the principles as have traditionally been the doctrines of the church of Jesus Christ from the beginning.\nWhen the revelations of the Lord are clearly understood, there is set forth the only basis of a united and universal church. It could not be accomplished as set forth by a man-made formula; it could only be accomplished when the fullness of the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ are taught and practiced, as declared by the apostle Paul to the Ephesians, who said that the church is “built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone.” (Eph. 2:20.)\nThe mission of the Church has also been defined:\n“And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days.\n“Wherefore the voice of the Lord is unto the ends of the earth, that all that will hear may hear.” (D&C 1:4, 11.)\nObedient to that instruction, and from the beginning of the Church, there have been missionaries sent to all parts of the world. Today we have increasing numbers of missionaries, mostly younger men, who have been schooled from their childhood to prepare themselves for a call to serve as missionaries.\nFrom a handful of missionaries in the early days of the Church, this number has been increased to over 17,000 serving today, each at his own expense, or at the expense of his immediate family, for a period of two or more years, each with a conviction in his heart that one so called has the divinity of his calling in his mind as he may go forth into any part of the world to which he may be called.\nAnother reason that might be given for the increase in the Lord’s work: perhaps as never before have there been so many people of the world searching for answers to the many perplexing problems.\nWhile the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ have not changed, the methods in meeting these challenges of the needs of today’s world must respond to the demands of our time. Fortunately the Lord has given, in the revelations to this church, the guidelines by which we should respond to the demands of the times. The plan of salvation has defined the way by which he would have us deal with the temporal needs of the people. The welfare plan of the Church seeks out those in distress. Where the newly found members are located, the plan of temporal salvation is, primarily, to teach the individuals how to take care of themselves. The Lord has provided a hedge against the terrifying impact upon the sanctity of the home and marriage, by strengthening the home and by providing guidelines to parents to teach their children the basic principles of honesty, virtue, integrity, thrift, and industry.\nThere is a concern of the Church for the individual members, from childhood to youth, and from among the youth into adulthood, to respond to the needs of members of the Church of every age.\nIn answer to the questions as to whether or not there may have been any dropouts or members who have fallen away, our answer has always been to recall the Master’s parable of the sower, where the sower went out to sow. Some of the seeds fell on fertile ground, but among the seeds which fell on fertile ground, some produced thirtyfold, some sixtyfold, and some ninetyfold. So today, in about that same ratio, we have some who are partially active, some are more so, and some who are thoroughly active in the Church, but we are always reaching out to the ones who have strayed away, and we are constantly trying to bring them back into full activity.\nBut perhaps the most important reason of all for the growth of the Church is the individual testimonies of the divinity of this work, as would be multiplied in the hearts of the individual members of the Church. For the strength of the Church is not in the numbers, nor in the amount of tithes and offerings paid by faithful members, nor in the magnitude of chapels and temple buildings, but because in the hearts of faithful members of the Church is the conviction that this is indeed the church and kingdom of God on the earth. Without that conviction, as one of my eminent business associates remarked, “The welfare plan of the Church would be but a shambles”; also missionary work would not flourish; and members would not be faithful in making generous contributions to the Church to finance its many operations. The secret of the strength of this church may be found in the statement of a president of a student body at one of our state-operated universities, whose identity, of course, is confidential. This is a quotation from his personal letter addressed to me:\n“With the rule of the radical ideas which are sweeping the country, there has come a breakdown of family ties which is despised in many intellectual circles. The country is seemingly plied with sex education, abortion, planned parenthood, pornography, women’s liberation, communal living, premarital sex, and postmarital permissiveness. …”\nAnd then this young college student leader concludes with this heartwarming declaration, which I know came from the depths of his soul. This is what he wrote:\n“President Lee, I want you to know that the Latter-day Saint students on campus who keep the commandments are 100 percent behind you. Thank God we have leaders who stand firm against the subtle battle of the adversary who is striking at the home, the most vital unit of the world. Thank you for being the kind of a person that we, as young people growing up in this mixed-up world, can understand and can follow.”\nBy that same token, and in the language of that brilliant college student, I am convinced that the greatest of all the underlying reasons for the strength of this church is that those who keep the commandments of God are 100 percent behind the leadership of this church. Without that united support it would be readily understood that this church could not go forward to meet the challenges of the day. Our call is for the total membership of the Church to keep the commandments of God, for therein lies the safety of the world. As one keeps the commandments of God, he is not only persuaded as to the righteousness of the course that is being followed under the leadership of the Church, but also will have the Spirit of the Lord to guide him in his individual activities, for each baptized member has been given a sacred endowment when he was baptized and which has been committed to every baptized member of the Church by the authority of the priesthood: the gift of the Holy Ghost, which, as the Master declared, would teach all things, would bring all things to their remembrance, and even show them things to come. (See John 14:26.)\nIt will be clearly understood, then, that the great responsibility that the leaders and teachers in the Church have is to persuade, to teach, to direct aright, that the commandments of Almighty God will be so lived as to prevent the individual from falling into the trap of the evil one who would persuade him not to believe in God and not to follow the leadership of the Church.\nI want to bear my sacred witness that because I know of the divinity of this work, I know that it will prevail; and that though there may be enemies within and without the Church who would seek to undermine and would seek to find fault and try to undermine the influence of the Church in the world, this church will be borne off triumphantly and will stand through the test of time when all the man-made efforts and weapons forged against the Lord’s word will fall by the wayside. I know that our Lord and Master Jesus Christ is the head of this church; that he has daily communion through agencies known to him, not only to the leaders of the Church in high positions, but also to individual members as they keep the commandments of God. To that I bear my sacred witness and leave my blessing upon all the faithful of the Church, and indeed in the world everywhere, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "month": "04",
        "year": 1973,
        "content": "The Lord closed section 1 in the Doctrine and Covenants with these words: “What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.” (D&C 1:38.)\nWe have just heard the voice of his servant, and it is the same! President Lee has done what all prophets in all ages have done. He has testified that God, our Father, lives; that Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer, the head of this church. He has testified that Joseph Smith was the prophet of the restoration. Like all the prophets before him, he has declared that the way to peace is found only in the gospel of Jesus Christ; that only by keeping God’s commandments, as revealed through the living prophets, can we find eternal life.\nWhat is a living prophet? His age? He may be young or old. He need not wear a tunic nor carry a shepherd’s staff. His physical features are not important. A prophet need not have advanced educational degrees nor come from any special social class. He may be rich or poor. He needs no credentials from men.\nWhat is it, then, that qualifies a man to be a prophet?\nForemost, God must choose him as his prophet! This is entirely different than for man to choose God. The Savior, speaking to his apostles, said, “Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit. …” (John 15:16.)\n“We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands, by those who are in authority to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.” (A of F 1:5.)\nA prophet, then, is the authorized representative of the Lord. While the world may not recognize him, the important requirement is that God speaks through him. A prophet is a teacher. He receives revelations from the Lord. These may be new truths or explanations of truths already received.\nIt is an easy thing to believe in the dead prophets. Many people do. For some mysterious reason there is an aura of credibility about them. It is not so with the prophet who lives among us, who must meet life’s everyday challenges. But it is a great thing to believe in the living prophets. Our salvation is contingent upon our belief in a living prophet and adherence to his word. He alone has the right to revelation for the whole Church. His words, above those of any other man, ought to be esteemed and considered by the Church as well as by the world. One day this truth will be understood.\nSomeone has said, “That person is not truly converted until he sees the power of God resting upon the leaders of this church, and until it goes down into his heart like fire.”\nSome may wonder at such power and authority being vested in one man. “Could he not lead us astray?” they ask. President Wilford Woodruff once said, “I say to Israel, the Lord will never permit me or any other man who stands as president of this Church to lead you astray. It is not in the program. It is not in the mind of God. If I were to attempt that the Lord would remove me out of my place, and so he will any other man who attempts to lead the children of men astray from the oracles of God and from their duty.” ( [Bookcraft, 1946], pp. 212–13.)\nPresident Henry D. Moyle has said, “The older I get and the closer contact I have with the President of the Church, the more I realize that the greatest of all scripture which we have in the world today is current scripture. What the mouthpiece of God says to his children is scripture. It is his word and his will and his law made manifest through scripture, and I love it more than all other.” (BYU tri-stake fireside, January 1963.)\nThe Lord has given this promise to his servants: “And whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall be scripture, shall be the will of the Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord, shall be the word of the Lord, shall be the voice of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation.” (D&C 68:4.)\nPresident John Taylor said, “We require a living tree—a living fountain—living intelligence, proceeding from the living priesthood in heaven, through the living priesthood on earth. … And from the time that Adam first received a communication from God, to the time that John, on the Isle of Patmos, received his communication, or Joseph Smith had the heavens opened to him, it always required new revelations, adapted to the peculiar circumstances in which the churches or individuals were placed. Adam’s revelation did not instruct Noah to build his ark; nor did Noah’s revelation tell Lot to forsake Sodom; nor did either of these speak of the departure of the children of Israel from Egypt. These all had revelations for themselves, and so had Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Jesus, Peter, Paul, John, and Joseph. And so must we, or we shall make a shipwreck.” ( [Deseret Book Co., 1944], p. 34.)\nOrson Pratt has said, “The very moment that we set aside the living oracles we set aside the revelations of God. Why? Because the revelations of God command us plainly that we shall harken to the living oracles. Hence, if we undertake to follow the written word, and at the same time do not give heed to the living oracles of God, the written word will condemn us. …” ( vol. 7, p. 373.)\nIt is the right and responsibility of the prophets to counsel the Saints.\nPresident Wilford Woodruff said, “We, as a people, should not treat lightly this counsel, for I will tell you in the name of the Lord—and I have watched it from the time I became a member of this Church—there is no man who undertakes to run counter to the counsel of the legally authorized leader of this people that ever prospers. … you will find that all persons who take a stand against this counsel will never prosper. …\n“… We have been governed by counsel instead of commandment in many things, which has been a blessing to the saints. …” ( vol. 14, pp. 33, 36.)\nPresident Stephen L Richards comments on counsel: “… a moment’s reflection will convince you of the rather serious regard in which we hold counsel. While it is true that we characterize infraction of the law as sin, and we do not apply quite that drastic a terminology to failure to follow counsel, yet in the Church, under the priesthood, counsel always is given for the primary purpose of having the law observed, so that it does occupy a place of standing and importance, almost comparable to that law of the gospel.” ( February 26, 1957.)\nPresident J. Reuben Clark, Jr., pinpointed today’s need: “What we need today is not more prophets. We have the prophets. But what we need is more people with listening ears. That is the great need of our generation.\n“There are those who insist that unless the Prophet of the Lord declares, ‘Thus saith the Lord,’ the message may not be taken as revelation. This is a false testing standard. For while many of our modern revelations as contained in the Doctrine and Covenants do contain these words, there are many that do not.” ( July 31, 1954.)\nPresident Marion G. Romney clarified the responsibility of those who hear the witness of a servant of God: “We who are his present witnesses are but discharging our responsibility when we bring these testimonies of the prophets and our own testimonies … to your attention.\n“To the extent we do bring them to your attention, the responsibility passes from us to you to determine the credibility of the witnesses and their testimonies. Let no man underestimate the importance of his decision concerning this matter.” ( December 1967, p. 100.)\nIt is a privilege to follow the President of the Church.\nThere will be other General Authorities and prophets and apostles who will counsel us during this conference. May we listen and hear the voice of the Lord, for—\n“What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.\n“For behold, and lo, the Lord is God, and the Spirit beareth record, and the record is true, and the truth abideth forever and ever.” (D&C 1:38–39.)\nIn the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "“Now therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts; Consider your ways.\n“Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.\n“Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Consider your ways.” (Hag. 1:5–7.)\nI have read this great scripture and continue to be impressed with how clearly the Old Testament prophet describes the conditions of today. Almost daily we read of those who invest for little return. We eat food so refined that the nourishment is lacking. We witness the drink that can never satisfy the thirst for those who drink; the dressing for style, rather than warmth, comfort, and modesty; the high wages of the wage earner today which still do not satisfy or supply his needs.\nA noted historian several years ago summarized the reasons for the fall of Rome as follows:\n\nThe breakdown of the family and the rapid increase of divorce.\n\nThe spiraling rise of taxes and extravagant spending.\n\nThe mounting craze for pleasure and the brutalization of sports.\n\nThe decay of religion into myriads of confused forms, leaving the people without a uniform guide.\n\nOur unconquered appetites and consuming drive for material possessions appear to be leading us on a course so often repeated in history. Greed, lust, and desire historically have only led mankind to waste, destruction, and suffering.\nJames E. Talmage has written:\n“Material belongings, relative wealth or poverty, physical environment—the things on which we are prone to set our hearts and anchor our aspirations, the things for which we sweat and strive, ofttimes at the sacrifice of happiness and to the forfeiture of real success—these after all are but externals, the worth of which in the reckoning to come shall be counted in terms of the use we have made of them.” (James E. Talmage, 1919, p. 352.)\nIsn’t this the time and isn’t this the hour to follow the admonition of the Lord to “consider your ways”?\nI have spent considerable time since the last general conference examining my ways to determine what I have to do to measure up to the calling the Prophet has issued to me. Let me share one or two of these lessons that this new experience has given me.\nFor 21 years, before receiving this call, I was employed by some of the great department stores of the country. I have been blessed with some close associations with some of the most talented leaders this industry has produced. I find myself today making a comparison between my former business associates and those with whom I am now busily engaged. Both groups have great leaders, but how different is their motivation! I have found in these Brethren seated before you the fulfillment in their lives of the promise given to the Prophet Joseph Smith:\n“… let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.\n“The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion. …” (D&C 121:45–46.)\nI have watched them armed with the Holy Ghost as a constant companion, taking on enormous work loads at an age when most men would be confined to rocking chairs, and engaging in strenuous travel schedules with great enthusiasm to be anxiously engaged in building the kingdom of God. Then by observation, the realization has come to me that this great Spirit that blesses them in their activities is not a special gift to them alone, but is available to all mankind if they will but be partakers and earnestly seek it and be humbly guided by it. “The office of the Holy Ghost is to enlighten the mind, to purify and sanctify the soul, to incite to good works, and to reveal the things of God.” (James E. Talmage, p. 167.)\nIsn’t this spirit a constant companion you need in your life? “Consider your ways.” Isn’t now the time to follow the Lord’s direction and receive the divine assurance that he is with you, guiding you in the paths that will make your life meaningful, rewarding, and satisfying?\nSecondly, I was reared in a home by noble parents who gave their children the security of love. We as a family were tied together by those great bonds. During our married life, with the exception of an occasional visit, we have lived at least a thousand miles away from our family center. What a great enjoyment it is to be near them again!\nThe last high school basketball tournament gave our family a rallying point for a common activity. My brother’s boy participated on one of the teams. They had lost their first game, and his personal production for that game was 12 points. This was about average for what he had been doing during the regular season. Then tragedy struck the team in the second game. Their big center, who was their high scorer, was injured and was out for the balance of the tournament. The team realized that another loss meant elimination.\nMy nephew was placed under the pressure of having to make up for that loss. He was moved from his regular position of forward to replace the center. He met the challenge by scoring 32 points that game. Then in the final two games he led the team to victory and finished second in total scoring in the state tournament. His scoring was twice what he had normally been producing.\nBearing his testimony the following week in meeting, he remarked that when the pressure became great and the burden difficult to bear, he would hear the encouraging cries of his family above the roar of the crowd and would be inspired to try harder.\nThe courage of this young man taught us all a lesson that day. One of the gifts of a loving family is the encouragement and confidence we receive to magnify ourselves. Is your family one of strength, help, and support one for another, or do you waste and depreciate one of the greatest gifts of our eternal Father with jealousy, bickering, or the lack of interest of one for another? Do you fail to communicate the love you have for each other and thus deprive yourself of some of life’s choicest moments?\nOne of our prophets has said: “I have but one thought in my heart for the young folk of the Church and that is that they be happy. I know of no other place than home where more happiness can be found in this life. It is possible to make home a bit of heaven; indeed, I picture heaven to be a continuation of the ideal home.” (President David O. McKay, p. 490.)\n“Consider your ways.” Isn’t this the time to bring that sweet influence of the Lord into your home?\nThe home we have just purchased since moving west has one unique feature. The small study provided has an adjoining large closet about one-fourth the size of the entire study. We thought when we were considering the purchase of the home that this closet was an error in design. Since occupying the home, it has become one of my favorite places. Here is where I can shut myself off from the world and communicate with my Father in heaven. “But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.” (Matt. 6:6.)\n“Consider your ways.” Couldn’t your life stand some open rewarding by the Father? Isn’t this the time to learn how to communicate with our Father which is in heaven?\nI leave you my witness that I know that God lives. I know that his Son is directing the affairs of this church today through his chosen prophet. I sustain and support him.\n“Consider your ways.” If that witness has not been given to you, isn’t now the time to seek it? Come and join with us, and let us continue to build the kingdom of God here and now, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "My beloved brothers and sisters: I am grateful for this opportunity and with each of you express gratitude for this lovely choir. I always have a little glimpse into heaven as I listen to them sing, and I feel lifted up. This entire conference has been lifted and edified by their great singing this morning.\nI feel closer to heaven and have better insight as to what heaven might be like as I feel the spirit of you wonderful leaders assembled here today. There is a feeling of unity, a feeling of strength, a feeling of wanting to do that which the Lord has asked us to do. I am grateful to be in your presence. I often think of President David O. McKay’s great observation that heaven would be just an extension of the ideal home. I believe that with all my heart, and it is that feeling that I sense with us here.\nSpeaking of heaven and the hereafter, I would like to address my remarks to things I feel would be imperative in order that we might have the great privilege of one day living in the very presence of our Heavenly Father, which should be the objective of every Latter-day Saint.\nIt has been truthfully said that the Savior is even more concerned for our success here in mortality than we ourselves are, the reason being, of course, that he has greater capacity for concern and love than do we mortals. He also has a superior knowledge of the gospel plan and man’s potential in God’s divine, eternal scheme. As stated by one prophet, God’s work and glory is achieved through our attainment of immortality and eternal life. (See Moses 1:39.)\nSomeone once suggested that it would be relatively simple for Christ to do all of the religious teaching here on earth. How easy it would be for the Creator to deliver every sermon and to teach every Sunday School class by means of closed-circuit television! Each religious meeting place could be equipped with a large video screen, and the master teacher of all time could then present every gospel lesson and deliver every sermon in a way that would hold us spellbound and indeed convert even the most critical. I suppose it would also be within his power to take over all of the compassionate service for mankind, but such is contrary to the development of God’s children.\nBefore the foundations of this earth were laid, a glorious decision was made allowing you and me to be our brother’s keeper. By faith and service we would be able to achieve a degree of glory in the hereafter suited to our Christlike efforts and our Christlike attainments.\nAdversity, heartache, bitter disappointment, grievous transgression, and disability are but a few of the obstacles that beset the inhabitants of this world. Few, if any, escape. None would have to linger in despair for long, however, if man could just bring himself to heed that one great teaching recorded in the 25th chapter of Matthew. You all remember it.\nOn this occasion the Savior was describing the day of judgment, wherein those to be judged were divided, some on the right hand and some on the left. Finding themselves in a favored position, those on the right expressed surprise and wanted to know why the reward had come to them. The Savior replied:\n“For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:\n“Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.” (Matt. 25:35–36.)\nThen the righteous answered, stating that not once had they found him hungry or thirsty or a stranger; and then the Savior’s classic teaching: “Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.” (Matt. 25:40.)\nOther expressions of the Savior further confirm the same charges. He said: “Feed my sheep” (John 21:16); “… all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them” (Matt. 7:12). Then, having set the perfect example of service during his ministry, he concluded by saying, “Go, and do thou likewise.” (Luke 10:37.)\nDuring the past 12 months it has been my privilege to work closely with many emotionally disturbed people; others who have transgressed; some who have found themselves out of harmony with society; still others who were lonely and afraid. It has not been a year of discouragement and despair, however, because the vast majority of these people have made an important decision, and they have said: “I want to change my life. I am ready to take direction from someone who really cares.” And in this church, we have bishops and stake presidents who really care.\nHow touching it was to hear a hardened prisoner say: “That is the first time anybody ever told me they loved me.” This was after a six-year-old girl kissed him on the cheek during a Church-sponsored family home evening visit in the prison.\nConsider with me an unwed mother who came to her bishop with some reluctance. Her heart was belligerent, and she also had a drug problem; but months later, following compassionate service by many, she was heard to say: “Life was over for me. I didn’t want to live anymore, but things are different now, and I know the true meaning of God’s love.”\nA confirmed alcoholic found a new lease on life because an assigned couple had won his confidence, and they were there when he needed them. His problem is now history. His own family is back together for the first time in years.\nA sexual deviant discovered with help that his problem was not God-given, as so many had told him in the past, but rather self-acquired from an early age. He recently declared with confidence: “I have conquered Satan himself. Nothing can stop me now.”\nEvery success story of the past year has been the result of special effort on the part of people who cared. They cared enough to give some time and to be sincere and compassionate; in other words, to follow the great example set by the Savior.\nThe only joy that is comparable with the joy of the one receiving the help is the glow that seems to emanate from the one who has given so unselfishly of his time and strength to quietly help someone in need.\nThe Savior did not seem to be so much involved in giving money. You will remember that his gifts were in the form of personal attention, in performing an administration, and in sharing the gifts of the Spirit. In fact, it was the Savior who said: “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. …” (John 14:27.) We could add to peace the gift of love, the gift of immortality, the gift of eternal life, the gift of understanding, the gift of compassion, the gift of eternal justice. All of these gifts are beyond monetary consideration and could well be our gift to someone sometime, if we weren’t “too busy.”\nMembers of this church understand clearly that baptism is essential for entrance into the celestial kingdom. We also know and understand that total fulfillment can only be found in that ultimate celestial state called eternal life or exaltation, which, of course, is to live eternally in his holy presence.\nOnly those who have been justified and sanctified through service to their fellowmen can hope to reach such a lofty goal. To be justified is to be found acceptable in our “good works” as well as by our superior faith. James used this excellent example:\n“If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,\n“And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?” (James 2:15–16.)\nAfter citing other similar examples, he concludes with this thought: “Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.” (James 2:24.)\nMoroni explained that we are sanctified “by the grace of God” as we become “perfect in Christ” and “deny not his power.” (Moro. 10:33.)\nNo man can become “perfect in Christ” without a deep, abiding, and sincere concern for his fellow beings. This example just read from James cites physical needs. However, there are also emotional problems about us in every direction. Loneliness and discouragement, for example, are two of Satan’s most effective tools against us.\nIs there someone you know who needs a friend, a friend who is willing to listen to him? The Church is reaching out to such people as never before. Resource volunteers are being organized throughout the Church to help carry out one of the Savior’s most sacred challenges.\nThere are those who associate high calling in the Church with guaranteed rights to the blessings of heaven, but I wish to declare without reservation that the ultimate judgment for every man will be on the simplest terms, and most certainly on what each has done to bless other people in a quiet, unassuming way.\nIf this life’s effort is to be justified, then there should be a major and continuing attempt to justify or, in other words, to conform our actions with the example of the Master. The central theme of his mortal span was purely and simply serving those about him. He fulfilled an eternal truth which should be a part of your life and my life. “And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant.” (Matt. 20:27.)\nIf our life’s effort is to be sanctified or, in other words, ratified by the standards of eternal truth, then our actions must be in harmony with the sanctifying principles of the gospel, which most certainly includes sincere concern for others and a concerted effort to alleviate their problems.\nI can think of no better guarantee for the future, your future and my future, than to follow the admonition of the Savior when he said at the beginning of his ministry: “Come and follow me” (Matt. 19:21); and then, after showing the way, he said very simply, “Go, and do thou likewise.”\nBrothers and sisters, may we go and do likewise, is my fervent prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "A few weeks ago on a day when this area was experiencing one of its worst snowstorms, and that is saying quite a bit because we had plenty of severe weather this past winter, a handsome young serviceman and his beautiful bride-to-be encountered extreme difficulty in getting to the Salt Lake Temple for their marriage appointment. She was in one location in the Salt Lake Valley and he was to come from another nearby town. Heavy snows and winds had closed the highways during the night and early morning hours. After many hours of anxious waiting, some of us were able to help them get to the temple and complete their marriage plans before the day was over.\nHow grateful they, their families, and friends were for the assistance and concern in their keeping this most important appointment. My friend—we will call him Bill—expressed his deep gratitude with, “Thank you very much for all you did to make our wedding possible. I don’t understand why you went to all this trouble to help me. Really, I’m nobody.”\nI am sure Bill meant his comment to be a most sincere compliment, but I responded to it firmly, but I hope kindly, with, “Bill, I have never helped a ‘nobody’ in my life. In the kingdom of our Heavenly Father no man is a ‘nobody.’”\nThis tendency to wrongfully identify ourselves was again brought to my attention the other day during an interview with a troubled wife. Her marriage is in great difficulty. She has tried earnestly to correct the communication blocks with her husband but with little success. She is grateful for the time her bishop has spent in counseling. Her stake president has also been most patient and understanding in his willingness to try and help.\nAll of her problems are not resolved, but she is making progress. Her many contacts with properly channeled priesthood direction have left her not only grateful, but somewhat amazed. Her concluding observation the other day was, “I just don’t understand all of you people giving so much time and showing so much concern. After all, I’m really ‘nobody.’”\nI am certain our Heavenly Father is displeased when we refer to ourselves as “nobody.” How fair are we when we classify ourselves a “nobody”? How fair are we to our families? How fair are we to our God?\nWe do ourselves a great injustice when we allow ourselves, through tragedy, misfortune, challenge, discouragement, or whatever the earthly situation, to so identify ourselves. No matter how or where we find ourselves, we cannot with any justification label ourselves “nobody.”\nAs children of God we are somebody. He will build us, mold us, and magnify us if we will but hold our heads up, our arms out, and walk with him. What a great blessing to be created in his image and know of our true potential in and through him! What a great blessing to know that in his strength we can do all things!\nAmmon taught a great lesson not only to his brother Aaron, but to all of us in this day, in Alma 26:10–12:\n“And it came to pass that when Ammon had said these words, his brother Aaron rebuked him, saying: Ammon, I fear that thy joy doth carry thee away unto boasting.\n“But Ammon said unto him: I do not boast in my own strength, nor in my own wisdom; but behold, my joy is full, yea, my heart is brim with joy, and I will rejoice in my God.\n“Yea, I know … as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things; yea, behold, many mighty miracles we have wrought in this land, for which we will praise his name forever.”\nAs grievous as labeling ourselves as a “nobody” is man’s tendency to classify others as a “nobody.” Sometimes mankind is prone to identify the stranger or the unknown as a nobody. Often this is done for self-convenience and an unwillingness to listen. Countless numbers today reject Joseph Smith and his message because they will not accept a 14-year-old “nobody.” Others turn away from eternal restored truths available today because they will not accept a 19-year-old elder or a 21-year-old lady missionary or a neighbor down the street because they are “nobody,” so they may suppose.\nThere is no doubt in my mind that one of the reasons our Savior Jesus Christ was rejected and crucified was because in the eyes of the world he was blindly viewed as a “nobody,” humbly born in a manger, an advocate of such strange doctrine as “Peace on earth, good will toward men.”\nI bear witness to you and the world that Joseph Smith knew with earth-shattering impact he was “somebody” when, in answer to humble prayer, God appeared with his Son, Jesus Christ, and spoke unto Joseph, calling him by name. God through the centuries has often chosen what the world would classify as a “nobody” to bear his truths. Listen to Joseph Smith’s thoughts and self-analysis in this area:\n“It caused me serious reflection then, and often has since, how very strange it was that an obscure boy, of a little over fourteen years of age, and one, too, who was doomed to the necessity of obtaining a scanty maintenance by his daily labor, should be thought a character of sufficient importance to attract the attention of the great ones of the most popular sects of the day, and in a manner to create in them a spirit of the most bitter persecution and reviling. But strange or not, so it was, and it was the cause of great sorrow to myself.\n“However, it was nevertheless a fact that I had beheld a vision. …” (JS—H 1:23–24.)\nMay I remind all of us that Joseph Smith referred to himself as “an obscure boy” but never as a “nobody.” Joseph Smith was sustained all the days of his perilous life by the knowledge that in God’s strength he could accomplish all things.\nGod help us to realize that one of our greatest responsibilities and privileges is to lift a self-labeled “nobody” to a “somebody,” who is wanted, needed, and desirable. Our first obligation in this area of stewardship is to begin with self. “I am nobody” is a destructive philosophy. It is a tool of the deceiver.\nIt is heartbreaking when youth in difficulty look up and respond to offered guidance with, “What does it matter? I’m nobody.”\nIt is just as disturbing when a questioned student on campus responds with, “I am no one special on campus. I’m just one of the thousands. I’m really nobody.”\nMay we learn an important lesson from a missionary recently interviewed. This elder, in answer to the question, “How often do you receive letters from your parents?” responded with, “Very, very seldom.”\n“What are you doing about it?” I asked.\n“I’m still writing them every week.”\nHere is a young man who may have had some excuse to pity himself with a “nobody” label when his parents don’t bother to write, but he is having no part of this kind of attitude. Further conversation with him emphatically convinced me that here is a young man who is really someone. If his parents don’t write, that is their responsibility. His responsibility is to write, and that is just what he is doing with enthusiasm. I have never met this missionary’s mother or father, probably never will, but wherever they are, in my mind they are “somebody” just to have him for their son. This missionary will succeed because he knows he is someone and is conducting himself accordingly.\nMore than once during the past few months President Harold B. Lee has called me to his office to listen with him to someone he has invited to share a suggestion, concern, bewilderment, or heartache. Some might well conclude for President Lee that he just doesn’t have time for the least of these his brethren, but he knows well the worth of every soul in the kingdom. I recall one saying to President Lee at the time of departure, “I can’t believe you would take the time to listen to someone like me.”\nTo mothers, fathers, husbands, wives, and children everywhere, we declare that regardless of your present station in life you are someone special. Remember, you may be an obscure boy, girl, man, or woman, but you are not a “nobody.” Please enjoy with me one of the truly great parables in all of the holy scriptures as we think along this subject.\n“A certain man had two sons:\n“And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.\n“And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.\n“And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.\n“And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.\n“And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.\n“And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!\n“I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,\n“And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.\n“And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.\n“And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.\n“But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:\n“And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:\n“For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.\n“Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing.\n“And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.\n“And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.\n“And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him.\n“And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:\n“But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou has killed for him the fatted calf.\n“And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.\n“It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.” (Luke 15:11–32.)\nBrothers and sisters, think well again on these points, if you will. “Father, divide your goods and give me my share. I am going off on my own.” In the days ahead he wasted his possessions with riotous living. He became so low, so hungry, he lived with the swine. “Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.” His heart was crying out, “I am lower than the low. I am now absolutely nothing—I am absolutely nobody.”\nPlease weigh the impact of the father’s response once more. He saw the son coming; he ran to him; he kissed him; he placed his best robe on him; he killed the fatted calf; and they made merry together. This self-declared “nobody” was his son; he was “dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.”\nIn the father’s joy he also taught well his older, bewildered son that he too was someone. “Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.” Contemplate, if you will, the depth—yes, even the eternal proportions—of “all that I have is thine.” I declare with all the strength I possess that we have a Heavenly Father who claims and loves all of us regardless of where our steps have taken us. You are his son and you are his daughter, and he loves you.\nDo not allow yourself to be self-condemning. Avoid discouragement. Teach yourself correct principles and govern yourself with honor. Appropriately involve yourself in helping others. As we develop proper self-image in ourselves and others, I promise you the “nobody” attitude will completely disappear. Ever remember wherever you are today within the sound of my voice that you are someone.\nGod lives. He too is someone—real and eternal—and he wants us to be someone with him. I bear witness that in his strength we can become like him. I leave you this my witness and my testimony humbly and in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "Peter said, “If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God” (1 Pet. 4:11), which means he must be guided by the power of the Holy Ghost; and this is the thing, above all else, that I desire at this time.\nThis morning we heard the chief officer, the chief oracle of the kingdom of God on earth, give the mind and will and voice of the Lord to the Latter-day Saints and to the world. I can think of nothing more important at this time than to follow in that pattern, and speak as President Lee speaks, unless it is at all times to live as he lives so that I can have the association, eternally, of the kind of people with whom he will associate.\nI have counseled with the Lord as to what I should say today; have made some suggestions to him as to what I thought proper, subject, of course, to his approving concurrence; have received that concurrence; and if I may now be given an uttering tongue and you may be given a listening ear, then all of us together shall be edified as we now seek to worship the Lord in spirit and in truth.\nI have written a text of my own which I have entitled “Upon Judea’s Plains.”\n\nI stood upon Judea’s plains,\nAnd heard celestial sounds and strains;\nI heard an angel, free from sin,\nAnnounce the birth of David’s kin.\n\nOn shepherds watching sheep by night,\nThere came a shining, glorious light,\nAs holy choirs from heaven’s dome\nSaw God’s own Son make clay his home.\n\nAnd voices sweet sang this reprise:\n“To God on high, let praise arise;\nAnd peace, good will to men on earth;\nThis is the day of Jesus’ birth.”\n\nTo me there came this witness sure:\n“He is God’s Son, supreme and pure;\nTo earth he came, my soul to save\nFrom sin and death and from the grave.”\n\nNow salvation is in Christ. He is our Savior and Redeemer. He came into the world to redeem men from the temporal and spiritual death brought into the world by the fall of Adam, and he gave to us a plan and system of salvation that is called the gospel of Jesus Christ. This plan of salvation is that all men everywhere should have faith in Christ; should repent of their sins; should covenant in the waters of baptism to keep the commandments and serve God with all their heart, might, mind, and strength; that they should then receive the gift and companionship of the Holy Spirit and thereafter live in righteousness and devotion all their days, with the assurance and promise that by so doing they shall gain peace in this life and eternal glory in the life to come.\nNow we are the agents and representatives of the Lord. He has given us the fullness of his everlasting gospel. The heavens have been opened in our day. The voice of God is heard again. Angels have come from his presence. Keys and power, authority and priesthood have been given again to mortal men, and once again we have all of the laws and the prerogatives and possess all of the powers that are needed to save and exalt a human soul. We have in this kingdom, in this church, the keys of the kingdom of God, the keys of salvation for all men everywhere.\nAnd he has given us the same commission that he gave to people in ancient days who had similar powers, and that commission is to carry his word to all the world and make salvation available to all his children everywhere. Now this places upon us the obligation of learning how we are going to do this thing, this thing of such incomparable and transcendent magnitude. How are we going to proclaim the truths of salvation among our own people and take the message of the restoration to the world?\nThere are some eternal principles involved here, and what we do in our day is not only the same in principle, but is exactly and precisely what the prophets and righteous men have done in all ages past.\nIn the early days of this dispensation the Lord said, “… the elders, priests and teachers of this church shall teach the principles of my gospel, which are in the Bible and the Book of Mormon, in the which is the fulness of the gospel.” (D&C 42:12.) Then he said on another occasion that we were sent out “to testify and warn the people. …” (D&C 88:81.)\nI suppose these two commissions—on the one hand to teach the doctrines of the gospel, and on the other hand to testify by personal knowledge that we know that the things that we are proclaiming are true—I suppose these are perfectly illustrated in the ministry of the sons of Mosiah. The record says that “they were men of a sound understanding,” who “had searched the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God. But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power and authority of God.” (Alma 17:2–3.)\nNow this gives us two premises. On the one hand we are obligated and required to know the doctrines of the Church. We are to treasure up the words of eternal life. We are to reason as intelligently as we are able. We are to use every faculty and capacity with which we are endowed to proclaim the message of salvation and to make it intelligent to ourselves and to our Father’s other children. But after we have done that, and also in the process of doing it, we are obligated to bear testimony—to let the world know and our associate members of the Church know—that in our hearts, by the revelation of the Holy Spirit to our souls, we know of the truth and divinity of the work and of the doctrines that we teach.\n\nNow let me, if I may, take a classical illustration from the ancient records of how this is done. Peter and his associates had the same obligation for their day that we have for ours: to carry the message of salvation to the ends of the earth. I suppose Peter read and taught the revelations that Isaiah and the prophets gave about Christ and his gospel. He reasoned with the people about them. He followed the divine counsel, “Come now, and let us reason together. …” (Isa. 1:18.) He obeyed the divine decree, “… bring forth your strong reasons.” (Isa. 41:21.)\nBut he did something more than that. After he had taught the doctrines and after he had reasoned, he bore a personal witness of the truth and divinity of what he was presenting to his fellowmen; and the Lord prepared him to do just that by giving him spiritual experiences, by letting the power of the Holy Spirit rest upon him.\nYou will recall, for instance, that Peter and some others of the Twelve and a small group of saints were assembled in an upper room; that the Lord Jesus appeared; that the people there assembled were terrified and affrighted; and that the Lord said to them: “Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.” (Luke 24:38–39.) Then they stretched forth their hands and felt the wound marks that scarred his body. He called for meat and ate it before them.\nThomas was absent on this occasion and believed not the testimony of his fellow disciples; eight days later the Lord made a similar appearance to the whole group and said to him: “Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.” Thomas said: “My Lord and my God.” (See John 20:24–28.)\nAll this was done to show that Jesus had come forth from the tomb with a tangible body. It was the Lord’s way of giving to Peter and his associates a witness of the truth and divinity of his divine Sonship. If he rose from the dead, he was the Son of God; if he was the Son of God, then the gospel of salvation they were proclaiming was true; and so their obligation was to establish in the minds of men that Jesus rose from the dead. Now as I say, they might have attempted to do this by quoting Isaiah, or reasoning out of the revelations, which of course they did; but having so done, they then had to bear a personal witness; and I now read a sample of such a witness that Peter bore. He said to a group of assembled gentiles:\n“The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)\n“That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;\n“How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.\n“And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:\n“Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;\n“Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.\n“And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.” (Acts 10:36–42.)\nAnd then comes this comprehensive, all-inclusive statement: “To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.” (Acts 10:43.)\nLet me read one other testimony that Peter bore:\n“For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.\n“For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\n“And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.” (2 Pet. 1:16–18.)\nNow I do not minimize in any degree or to any extent the obligation that rests upon us to be gospel scholars, to search the revelations, to learn how to reason and analyze, to present the message of salvation among ourselves and to the world with all the power and ability we have; but that standing alone does not suffice. When that is all over, we have to comply with the command the Lord gave for us in this day: “… ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God.” (Isa. 43:12.) We have to put an approving, divine seal on the doctrine that we teach, and that seal is the seal of testimony, the seal of a personal knowledge borne of the Holy Ghost.\nNow Peter could have reasoned at great length, and after having so done people could have argued with him and said, “You don’t understand the scriptures. Your interpretations are in error. This or that is wrong.” But you can’t argue with a testimony, and so after Peter had reasoned, if he then said to them, as he must have done in substance and in thought content on many occasions, if he said to them, “I was in an upper room. The Lord Jesus came through the wall. He appeared to us. I recognized him. He was the same person with whom I had labored and traveled for three and a half years. He is the person who lived in my home in Capernaum. I then felt the nail marks in his hands and in his feet. I thrust my hand into his side. I was there when he ate food and drank before us. I know he is the Son of God. The Holy Spirit of God has borne this witness to my soul”—if he said this to them, there was nothing left to debate. You can’t argue with that kind of a presentation. You can say, as Festus said to Paul: “Thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad” (Acts 26:24), but in the final analysis all you can do is accept or reject the witness that is borne. It is either true or it is false. There is no middle ground.\n\nNow how do you prove and establish that the Father and the Son appeared to Joseph Smith; that angels came in our day; that there has been a restoration of the gospel; that all the glorious things we present to the world are true? Well, you reason out of the revelations. You can make a good case; and that isn’t any problem. The truth is with us. The Lord is the author of the system we have received. But after you have reasoned and after you have analyzed, you have got to stand as a personal witness who knows what he is saying. You have to do what the sons of Mosiah did—speak and teach by the spirit of prophecy and the spirit of revelation; and the result is that you speak as one having authority. This is the great thing that separates us from the world, and thanks be to God we have this knowledge. We have received this revelation, and we are in a position to speak as those having authority.\nAnd I attempt with all the vigor of my soul so to do on this occasion, because I am one, among many among great hosts in latter-day Israel, who has this knowledge. I know of myself of the truth and the divinity of this work and of the doctrine which I now teach.\nWe began with “Upon Judea’s Plains.” Let us close with “In an Upper Room.”\n\nWe sat at meat, our souls in pain,\nFor wicked men our Lord had slain:\nWe’d seen him on the cross of doom;\nHis body lay in Joseph’s tomb.\n\nThen by our board, he stood once more:\nHe lives, he lives—now as afore!\nHe ate, then drank; we saw, then felt,\nAs at his feet in awe we knelt.\n\nA calm command to Thomas came:\n“Feel thou my hands, they are the same\nAs when I hung upon the tree,\nAnd suffered death for me and thee.”\n\nTo me he said, in solemn tones:\n“My body feel; ’tis flesh and bones.”\nMy soul cried out: “Bow ’neath his rod;\nAcclaim him Savior, Lord, and God!”\n\nAnd of this I testify, in solemnity and sobriety, with full knowledge of what I speak. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "This is always a wonderful sight and a great occasion, brothers and sisters, and I thrill to add my testimony to that of our president and these great leaders who have preceded me. How delighted I felt this afternoon to see these young people assembled and to hear their sweet voices tell of, I think, the greatest story since the birth of our Savior.\nSomeone once said, “I am intensely interested in the future because I expect to spend the rest of my days there.” I get excited about young people such as these because they project that kind of a positive future. We love and trust them. Seeing them seated behind me brings to mind a short story from Mt. Kisco, New York, reported in the\n“Once upon a time, there was a little red schoolhouse with one big room for 27 children. The teacher sat with an American flag on one side of her and a blackboard on the other. The children sat in rows facing her, the littlest ones in front. The youngest was seven, and she was very little. The biggest was 16, and he was six feet tall. The youngest was smart, and she could read with the other children. The biggest was dumb, but he was strong and could help the teacher carry in wood. In bad weather, he carried the littlest girl across the puddle in front of the schoolhouse. And sometimes she helped him with his reading.\n“Then one day the state built a big highway, right past the schoolhouse door. And the State Education Department came by and said, ‘Great things are happening in education. There are special teachers for arithmetic, reading, art and music. If you combine with other schoolhouses, you could have a great big school where your children could have all the advantages. And big yellow buses could carry your children over the new highway right up to the school door.’ So the parents voted to consolidate, and the little red schoolhouse was abandoned.\n“At first things went well in the big school. But after a while, the State Education Department said that it wasn’t providing the children with enough meaningful experiences. And some parents complained that the children were not learning to read and write and figure as well as they had in the little red schoolhouse. ‘We will try some new things,’ said the educators. So they tried the ungraded primer, where fast readers were not slowed down by slow readers, and where children who had trouble with numbers did not get moved on to the next grade before they could add 3 and 5. This helped, but not enough.\n“‘We will try something more,’ the educators said. ‘We will tear down some walls at the new school, so the children will be working together in one big room. That way, there will be less peer-group competition.’\n“Finally, an important educator came along, looked at the school and said, ‘This is good, but it is not good enough. It is too big, and the children are losing their identity. There are not enough interpersonal relationships in the infrastructure. What we really need is a one-room schoolhouse. And since red is a cheerful color, I think we ought to paint it red.’” (From Mt. Kisco, N.Y., in March 1973, p. 68. Used by permission.)\nThe educator in this story did not mean that the consolidated school, the special teachers, or the ungraded primer were not advantages. The point of the story is that along with the wonderful new discoveries in education, the emphasis must still be placed upon the individual and upon his needs and relationships with others.\nThis philosophy applies just as importantly to Church organizations as it does to the little red schoolhouse. In a revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith just prior to the organization of the Church, the Lord said:\n“Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God;\n“For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh; wherefore he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and come unto him.\n“And he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring all men unto him, on conditions of repentance.” (D&C 18:10–12.)\nOur Lord’s response to the Pharisees’ question, “Why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?” was, “The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath.” (Mark 2:24, 27.)\nI understand from what the Lord has revealed to us through the prophets that people are his greatest concern. We are his children. We are somebody, as Elder Ashton so wonderfully stated this morning. We are his children, and he continually reveals himself through the prophets so that one day we can be like him.\nPrograms, then, wonderfully inspired programs, like the Sabbath, exist to help people. If we are not careful, it is very easy to put the mechanics of the program ahead of the person. Jesus was constantly trying to put the spirit back into the letter of the law. Our first priority, I feel, as parents, leaders, and teachers should be the individual within the home or Church program.\nI remember some years ago an experience I had while directing one of the religious education programs of the Church in Southern California.\nOne of my responsibilities as a coordinator was to secure property, eventually erect an institute building, and then provide a religious program for our college youth. We had secured a wonderful institute site adjacent to the Los Angeles State College. Shortly after the transaction was consummated, the State of California indicated to me that they wanted to take the property by right of eminent domain, which was their prerogative. I checked with my superiors and they said, “Look into the legal side and see if we still don’t have a chance.” I did. We went into court for a hearing. The judge was impressed with the program of the Church and what we do for youth and people. We were sent back to do some additional homework and gather added information.\nThe day came for the final hearing, and I had about eight hours of work to do in four when at that very moment about ten o’clock one morning a knock came at the door, and because of my frustration I almost said (but I didn’t), “COME IN!” Instead I said, “Come in.” And in the framework of that door stood a 19-year-old USC freshman student who had refused our offers to come and join our group on four previous occasions. His head bowed, hands in his pockets, he said, “Brother Dunn, I have got to see you, now.” And I almost said (but I didn’t), “Can’t you see I am busy?” Because I was. Fortunately I had the presence of mind to invite him in; and as he took a chair, several questions went through my mind.\nQuestion number 1, “What are you going to court for this morning, Paul?” “Well, to try to save a piece of property.” “What do you want the piece of property for, Paul?” “Well, to erect a building.” “Well, what do you want a building for?” “Well, to teach some students.” “What just knocked on your door?” “Oh, a student.” And wouldn’t you know, he took the whole four hours.\nThe time came for legal counsel to arrive, and we went to court. I don’t know all of the ramifications. We lost the hearing and eventually the piece of property, and it took us two years to secure another site. You would be happy with what the Church has done at Los Angeles State College, but more important, we saved the boy. Had it been your son, I think you would agree that we made the right decision.\nGod grant us the vision as leaders, teachers, and parents to put people first. Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God. I add my personal witness. God lives. Jesus is the Christ. This is his church. This is his prophet. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "month": "04",
        "year": 1973,
        "content": "It was a wintry Sunday morning in northern New York. The temperature was several degrees below freezing. The walks were icy; roads were blocked with heavy snowdrifts. No one came to church that morning except the minister and an 89-year-old woman, who had hobbled ten blocks from where she lived.\nSurprised at seeing her, the minister called her by name and asked: “How did you get here on such a stormy morning?”\n“My heart gets here first,” was the cheerful reply, “and then it’s easy for the rest of me.” ( January 26, 1973, p. 5.)\nThis simple illustration brings to mind that all individuals are confronted with decisions to make every day, and whatever the choice, it is commensurate with the persuasion of the heart.\nThese persuasions of the heart are related to two opposing forces constantly at work within every human being. They are the forces of good and evil, which the Master referred to as God and mammon. Coupled with these forces is the individual’s power to reason, which only man, of all God’s creations, possesses. This enables him to make choices. It is man’s control valve of what he wants to be. The forces governed by his own reasoning determine the nature and quality of the choice made. Thus, that which we call character is formed. We refer to this privilege of choice as the agency of man.\nIt has been said that “every day is election day, for throughout every hour of every day we each exercise our right of choice. We don’t have to have a local or national election in order to elect or vote. … A man’s election can determine the deciding vote for or against his own success. … You elect to gain a thorough knowledge of your business or you don’t. You elect to be honest or you don’t. You elect to save a part of what you earn or you don’t. You elect to always do your best or you don’t. And by your own election you will be defeated or you will succeed.” (Jim Love, Research and Review Service of America, Inc., vol. 10, p. 64.)\nOur Father in heaven was aware of the reality of this principle of agency in the beginning. We read from the scriptures in some detail:\n“Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; …\n“And God saw these souls that they were good. …\n“And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;\n“And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them;\n“And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; … and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever.\n“And the Lord said: Whom shall I send? And one answered like unto the Son of Man: Here am I, send me.” (Abr. 3:22–27.) And that one said, “Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever.” (Moses 4:2.)\n“… And another answered and said: Here am I, send me.” (Abr. 3:27.)\n“I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.” (Moses 4:1.)\n“… And the Lord said: I will send the first.\n“And the second was angry, and kept not his first estate. …” (Abr. 3:27–28.) “And he became Satan, … the father of all lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto my voice.” (Moses 4:4.)\nSatan rebelled against God and “sought to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him. …” (Moses 4:3.)\nUnfortunately, many do not realize the quality and blessing of that gift of agency of man. If we would but reason the matter, we would come to realize as is expressed in this thought: “Choice is an element of human dignity. Without the power of choice, a man is a lot less than a man. Without the exercise of choice a man never discovers what he can be or what he can do. Choice is the key to the future.” (George E. Farling, “Youth Can’t, But Must,”)\nSince the authorship of the agency of man is God’s, should we not look to him for the best media to help us to control our choices? The media he has given to us are the words spoken by his prophets, as are recorded in the scriptures. Jesus confirms this in responding to the recreant Jews of his time, who accused him of breaking the Sabbath by healing a man on that day. He included in his rebuke to them these words:\n“And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.\n“And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.\n“Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.\n“And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.” (John 5:37–40.)\nThe guide to the answer to their problem was to be found in the scriptures. He rebuked them for not accepting the scriptures that they had. The guide to the solution to every problem of life is to be found there. The knowledge on which to pursue our reasoning is in them. Listen to the counsel of Paul to Timothy:\n“And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Jesus Christ.\n“All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:\n“That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.” (2 Tim. 3:15–17.)\nAs fellow workers for the cause of building the kingdom of God, they are our source of faith, commitment, determination, and leadership; doctrine for the foundation of our decisions. Let us refer to the scriptures for a few well-known examples to illustrate. I refer to the example of the faith of Job, a very affluent, God-fearing man, having much of the world’s goods and a fine family. Overnight, he suffered the sudden loss of all his earthly possessions and his children and then responded to the situation with faith and realism.\nHe “rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,\n“And said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.” (Job 1:20–21.)\nThen upon being rendered with bodily affliction and poor health, his own wife chided him and said to him, “Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.”\nJob answered, “Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?” (Job 2:9–10.)\nAnd then in the midst of all his afflictions, Job gave this testimony: “For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.” (Job 19:25–26.)\nAs to commitment, is there a more touching example of devotion than Ruth to her mother-in-law, Naomi, as Naomi pled with Ruth to return to her own people following the death of her husband, when Ruth clave unto her and said:\n“Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:\n“Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.” (Ruth 1:16–17.)\nAnd Queen Esther, in her determination to save her kindred people from destruction, seeking God’s help through fasting, instructed Mordecai: “Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.” (Esth. 4:16.)\nAnd Joshua the leader, as he turned the hearts of the belligerent people by his example of choice, spoke to them: “Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the Lord.\n“And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.\n“And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the Lord, to serve other gods;\n“And the people said unto Joshua, The Lord our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.” (Josh. 24:14–16, 24.)\nThese are but a few of the unnumbered examples to be found in the scriptures, but even as we examine these few evidences of outstanding characters, our spirits receive the inspiration of their strength. Reasoning tells us that the development of their lives had to be built on making proper choices. They were established on truth. Their examples teach us celestial lessons.\nThe Lord’s call to us is: “Come now, and let us reason together. …” (Isa. 1:18.) He wants us to listen to and consider his doctrine. The scriptures tell us this: “… that men might be made partakers of the glories which were to be revealed, the Lord sent forth the fulness of his gospel, his everlasting covenant, reasoning in plainness and simplicity.” (D&C 133:57.)\nHe wants us to become acquainted with his gospel, to test it, to prove it, to participate in it, and to use it as a base on which to make our decisions. This is that men might base their choices on truth. When reason is joined with truth, there is convincing logic that sets up the path in our hearts that leads upward and onward to a nobler life.\nReason is only compatible with truth. Error and evil, no matter how one may try to reason with it, still remain error and evil leading to chaos. It is difficult to understand that anyone, after examining the truth, could “say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.” (Job 21:14.)\nOne of the sad expressions of the scriptures is when Christ said: “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.” (Matt. 23:37–38.)\nThe expression is applicable in this day to those who deliberately will not come and reason with the Lord.\nLet us incline our hearts toward God, that we may receive these words of John:\n“Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.\n“And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.\n“And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.\n“And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.” (1 Jn. 3:21–24.)\nIn the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "President Romney recently said, “Welfare is not a program of the Church; it is of the essence of the Church.” I truly believe that. Welfare is more than just furnishing the temporal needs of the Church members. Welfare is for every single member of the Church. It involves the 96 percent who do not need to be assisted by the commodities and by those things furnished by the bishop’s storehouse. Welfare is for those who have, to give, as well as those who have not, to receive.\nNow the scriptures are replete with verses bearing witness to what President Romney has said. In Mosiah, King Benjamin said:\n“… and ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain. …\n“Perhaps thou shalt say: The man has brought upon himself his misery; therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him of my food, nor impart unto him of my substance … for his punishments are just—\n“But … whosoever doeth this the same hath great cause to repent; and except he repenteth of that which he hath done he perisheth forever, and hath no interest in the kingdom of God.\n“For behold, are we not all beggars? …” (Mosiah 4:16–18.)\nAnd then clearly Paul said: “Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.” (1 Cor. 13:1.)\nAnd then, of course, the great Savior of heaven and earth, in one of his great parables, taught us a most profound lesson. He said:\n“There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:\n“And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,\n“And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.\n“And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died and was buried;\n“And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.\n“And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.\n“But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.\n“And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.\n“Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house:\n“For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.\n“Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.\n“And he said, Nay, father Abraham; but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.\n“And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.” (Luke 16:19–31.)\nI believe the Savior here teaches us a great lesson. There are those who have want, and in his great charitable way he will provide, for I believe the pure love of Christ is welfare. I believe it seeks out beyond the dimensions of that which we do. I think it is charity in its purest form.\nMyra Brooks Welch in her great poem, “The Touch of the Master’s Hand,” said:\n\n“’Twas battered and scarred, and the auctioneer\nThought it scarcely worth his while\nTo waste much time on the old violin,\nBut held it up with a smile:\n‘What am I bidden, good folks,’ he cried,\n‘Who’ll start the bidding for me?’\n‘A dollar, a dollar’; then, ‘Two!’ ‘Only two?\nTwo dollars, and who’ll make it three?\nThree dollars, once; three dollars, twice;\nGoing for three—’ But no,\nFrom the room, far back, a gray-haired man\n\nCame forward and picked up the bow;\nThen, wiping the dust from the old violin,\nAnd tightening the loose strings,\nHe played a melody pure and sweet\nAs sweet as a caroling angel sings.\n\n“The music ceased, and the auctioneer,\nWith a voice that was quiet and low,\nSaid, ‘What am I bid for the old violin?’\nAnd he held it up with the bow.\n‘A thousand dollars, and who’ll make it two?\nTwo thousand! And who’ll make it three?\nThree thousand, once, three thousand, twice,\nAnd going, and gone!’ said he.\nThe people cheered, but some of them cried,\n‘We do not quite understand\nWhat changed its worth.’ Swift came the reply:\n‘The touch of a master’s hand.’\n\n“And many a man with life out of tune,\nAnd battered and scarred with sin,\nIs auctioned cheap to the thoughtless crowd,\nMuch like the old violin.\nA ‘mess of pottage,’ a glass of wine;\nA game—and he travels on.\nHe’s ‘going’ once, and ‘going’ twice,\nHe’s ‘going’ and almost ‘gone.’\nBut the Master comes, and the foolish crowd\nNever can quite understand\nThe worth of a soul and the change that’s wrought\nBy the touch of the Master’s hand.”\n\nI believe that is what it is. It is more than just physical welfare. It is the social and emotional needs furnished and provided and trained and taught in the Church. It is taking care of the health of those who have twisted bodies. I believe we have a great and sacred responsibility in this area. I think President Lee probably said it more beautifully in our day than any I have read. In 1946 in the October conference, he said:\n“I know there are powers that can draw close to one who fills his heart with … love. … I came to a night, some years ago, when on my bed, I realized that before I could be worthy of the high place to which I had been called, I must love and forgive every soul that walked the earth, and in that time I came to know and I received a peace and a direction, and a comfort, and an inspiration, that told me things to come and gave me impressions that I knew were from a divine source.” ( October 1946, p. 146.)\nIsn’t it having the prophet feel the responsibility of caring for every living soul on the earth, loving and forgiving them?\nI have a great friend, Brother Les Goates, a great and gifted writer, and I asked him if I could lift a part of a story. He told how welfare first came into his home:\n“But ‘as for me and my house,’ the welfare program began in the Old Field west of Lehi on the Saratoga Road in the autumn of 1918, that terribly climactic year of World War I during which more than 14 million people died of that awful scourge ‘the black plague,’ or Spanish influenza.\n“Winter came early that year and froze much of the sugar beet crop in the ground. My dad and brother Francis were desperately trying to get out of the frosty ground one load of beets each day which they would plow out of the ground, cut off the tops, and toss the beets, one at a time, into the huge red beet wagon and then haul the load off to the sugar factory. It was slow and tedious work due to the frost and the lack of farm help, since my brother Floyd and I were in the army and Francis, or Franz, as everybody called him, was too young for the military service.\n“While they were thusly engaged in harvesting the family’s only cash crop and were having their evening meal one day, a phone call came through from our eldest brother, George Albert, superintendent of the State Industrial School in Ogden, bearing the tragic news that Kenneth, nine-year-old son of our brother Charles, the school farm manager, had been stricken with the dread ‘flu,’ and after only a few hours of violent sickness, had died on his father’s lap; and would dad please come to Ogden and bring the boy home and lay him away in the family plot in the Lehi Cemetery.\n“My father cranked up his old flap-curtained Chevrolet and headed for Five Points in Ogden to bring his little grandson home for burial. When he arrived at the home he found ‘Charl’ sprawled across the cold form of his dear one, the ugly brown discharge of the black plague oozing from his ears and nose and virtually burning up with fever.\n“‘Take my boy home,’ muttered the stricken young father, ‘and lay him away in the family lot and come back for me tomorrow.’\n“Father brought Kenneth home, made a coffin in his carpenter shop, and mother and our sisters, Jennie, Emma, and Hazel, placed a cushion and a lining in it, and then dad went with Franz and two kind neighbors to dig the grave. So many were dying the families had to do the grave digging. A brief graveside service was all that was permitted.\n“The folks had scarcely returned from the cemetery when the telephone rang again and George Albert (Bert) was on the line with another terrifying message: Charl had died and two of his beautiful little girls—Vesta, 7, and Elaine, 5—were critically ill, and two babies—Raeldon, 4, and Pauline, 3—had been stricken.\n“Our good cousins, the Larkin undertaking people, were able to get a casket for Charl and they sent him home in a railroad baggage car. Father and young Franz brought the body from the railroad station and placed it on the front porch of our old country home for an impromptu neighborhood viewing but folks were afraid to come near the body of a black plague victim. Father and Francis meanwhile had gone with neighbors to get the grave ready and arrange a short service in which the great, noble spirit of Charles Hyrum Goates was commended into the keeping of his Maker.\n“Next day my sturdy, unconquerable old dad was called on still another of his grim missions—this time to bring home Vesta, the smiling one with the raven hair and big blue eyes.\n“When he arrived at the home he found Juliett, the grief-crazed mother, kneeling at the crib of darling little Elaine, the blue-eyed baby angel with the golden curls. Juliett was sobbing wearily and praying: ‘Oh, Father in heaven, not this one, please! Let me keep my baby! Do not take any more of my darlings from me!’\n“Before father arrived home with Vesta the dread word had come again. Elaine had gone to join her daddy, brother Kenneth, and Sister Vesta. And so it was that father made another heartbreaking journey to bring home and lay away a fourth member of his family, all within the week.\n“The telephone did not ring the evening of the day they laid away Elaine nor were there any more sad tidings of death the next morning. It was assumed that George A. and his courageous companion Della, although afflicted, had been able to save the little ones Raeldon and Pauline; and it was such a relief that Cousin Reba Munns, a nurse, had been able to come in and help.\n“After breakfast dad said to Franz, ‘Well, son, we had better get down to the field and see if we can get another load of beets out of the ground before they get frozen in any tighter. Hitch up and let’s be on our way.’\n“Francis drove the four-horse outfit down the driveway and dad climbed aboard. As they drove along the Saratoga Road, they passed wagon after wagon-load of beets being hauled to the factory and driven by neighborhood farmers. As they passed by, each driver would wave a greeting: ‘Hi ya, Uncle George,’ ‘Sure sorry, George,’ ‘Tough break, George,’ ‘You’ve got a lot of friends, George.’\n“On the last wagon was the town comedian, freckled-faced Jasper Rolfe. He waved a cheery greeting and called out: ‘That’s all of ‘em, Uncle George.’\n“My dad turned to Francis and said: ‘I wish it was all of ours.’\n“When they arrived at the farm gate, Francis jumped down off the big red beet wagon and opened the gate as we drove onto the field. He pulled up, stopped the team, paused a moment and scanned the field, from left to right and back and forth—and lo and behold, there wasn’t a sugar beet on the whole field. Then it dawned upon him what Jasper Rolfe meant when he called out: ‘That’s all of ‘em, Uncle George!’\n“Then dad got down off the wagon, picked up a handful of the rich, brown soil he loved so much, and then in his thumbless left hand a beet top, and he looked for a moment at these symbols of his labor, as if he couldn’t believe his eyes.\n“Then father sat down on a pile of beet tops—this man who brought four of his loved ones home for burial in the course of only six days; made caskets, dug graves, and even helped with the burial clothing—this amazing man who never faltered, nor flinched, nor wavered throughout this agonizing ordeal—sat down on a pile of beet tops and sobbed like a little child.\n“Then he arose, wiped his eyes with his big, red bandanna handkerchief, looked up at the sky, and said: ‘Thanks, Father, for the elders of our ward.’”\nIsn’t that what the Lord would want us to do if he were here to show us the way, for didn’t he entreat us by saying:\n“Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\n“Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\n“For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” (Matt. 11:28–30.)\nWho received the greater blessing? Was it the elders who went out into the field and harvested Brother Goates’ load of beets? I want you to know they received a great blessing.\nAnd now in conclusion, you remember the words of Paul. He said: “And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.” (1 Cor. 13:13.)\nAnd I pray that the charity of Jesus Christ will be with and abide with each one of us, that we will understand the total dimension of welfare services in the Church, in the name of Jesus Christ, our Master. Amen."

        "content": "The prophet Ezekiel declared:\n“Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.\n“When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.\n“Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.” (Ezek. 3:17–19.)\nThe inspired Book of Mormon prophets saw our day and warned us of the strategy of the adversary. Hear their words:\n“For behold, at that day shall he [the devil] rage in the hearts of the children of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good.\n“And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security. …\n“… wo be unto him that hearkeneth unto the precepts of men, and denieth the power of God. …” (2 Ne. 28:20–21, 26.)\nThrough a modern prophet, Joseph Smith, the Lord has given this further warning: “Wherefore the voice of the Lord is unto the ends of the earth, that all that will hear may hear:\n“… and the day cometh that they who will not hear the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his servants, neither give heed to the words of the prophets and apostles, shall be cut off from among the people;\n“For they have strayed from mine ordinances, and have broken mine everlasting covenant;\n“They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own God, whose image is in the likeness of the world. …\n“What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice, or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.” (D&C 1:11, 14–16, 38.)\nThese warnings were given 140 years ago. The fulfillment is now. We are living witnesses, unless we are blinded by our own complacency and the craftiness of evil men.\nAs watchmen on the tower of Zion, it is our obligation and right as leaders to speak out against current evils—evils that strike at the very foundation of all we hold dear as the true church of Christ and as members of Christian nations.\nAs one of these watchmen, with a love for humanity, I accept humbly this obligation and challenge and gratefully strive to do my duty without fear. In times as serious as these, we must not permit fear of criticism to keep us from doing our duty, even at the risk of our counsel being tabbed as political, as government becomes more and more entwined in our daily lives.\nIn the crisis through which we are now passing, we have been fully warned. This has brought forth some criticism. There are some of us who do not want to hear the message. It embarrasses us. The things which are threatening our lives, our welfare, our freedoms are the very things some of us have been condoning. Many do not want to be disturbed as they continue to enjoy their comfortable complacency.\nThe Church is founded on eternal truth. We do not compromise principle. We do not surrender our standards regardless of current trends or pressures. Our allegiance to truth as a church is unwavering. Speaking out against immoral or unjust actions has been the burden of prophets and disciples of God from time immemorial. It was for this very reason that many of them were persecuted. Nevertheless, it was their God-given task, as watchmen on the tower, to warn the people.\nWe live in an age of appeasement—the sacrificing of principle. Appeasement is not the answer. It is never the right answer.\nOne of these modern Church watchmen has given this sound warning:\n“A milk-and-water allegiance kills; while a passionate devotion gives life and soul to any cause and its adherents. The troubles of the world may largely be laid at the doors of those who are neither hot nor cold; who always follow the line of least resistance; whose timid hearts flutter at taking sides for truth. As in the great Council in the heavens, so in the Church of Christ on earth, there can be no neutrality. We are, or we are not, on the side of the Lord. An unrelenting faith, contemptuous of all compromise, will lead the Church and every member of it, to triumph and the achievement of our high destiny.\n“The final conquerors of the world will be the men and women, few or many matters not, who fearlessly and unflinchingly cling to truth, and who are able to say no, as well as yes, on whose lofty banner is inscribed: No compromise with error. …\n“Tolerance is not conformity to the world’s view and practices. We must not surrender our beliefs to get along with people, however beloved or influential they may be. Too high a price may be paid for social standing or even for harmony. … The Gospel rests upon eternal truth; and truth can never be deserted safely.” (John A. Widtsoe, April 1941, pp. 117, 116.)\nIt has been well said that “our greatest national problem is erosion. Not erosion of the soil, but erosion of the national morality.”\nThe United States of America has been great because it has been free. It has been free because it has trusted in God and was founded upon the principles of freedom set forth in the word of God. This nation has a spiritual foundation. To me, this land has a prophetic history.\nIn the year 1831 Alexis de Tocqueville, the famous French historian, came to our country at the request of the French government to study our penal institutions. He also made a close study of our political and social institutions. In less than ten years, de Tocqueville had become world-famous, as the result of the four-volume work that he wrote, entitled Here is his own stirring explanation of the greatness of America:\n“I sought for the greatness and genius of America in her commodious harbors and her ample rivers, and it was not there; in her fertile fields and boundless prairies, and it was not there; in her rich mines and her vast world commerce, and it was not there. Not until I went to the churches of America and heard her pulpits aflame with righteousness did I understand the secret of her genius and power. America is great because she is good, and if America ever ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.” ( compiled by Jerreld L. Newquist [Salt Lake City, Publishers Press, 1964], p. 60.)\nHow strong is our will to remain free—to be good? False thinking and false ideologies, dressed in the most pleasing forms, quietly—almost without our knowing it—seek to reduce our moral defenses and to captivate our minds. They entice with bright promises of security, cradle-to-grave guarantees of many kinds. They masquerade under various names, but all may be recognized by one thing—one thing they all have in common: to erode away character and man’s freedom to think and act for himself.\nEffort will be made to lull us away into a false security. Proposals will be and are being offered and programs sponsored that have wide appeal. Attractive labels are usually attached to the most dangerous programs, often in the name of public welfare and personal security. Again, let us not be misled.\nFreedom can be killed by neglect as well as by direct attack.\n\nToo long have too many Americans, and people of the free world generally, stood by as silent accessories to the crimes of assault against freedom—assault against basic economic and spiritual principles and traditions that have made nations strong.\nLet us strive for progress down the road of goodness and freedom. With the help and blessings of the Lord, the free people of the United States and the free world can and will face tomorrow without fear, without doubt, and with full confidence. We do not fear the phony population explosion, nor do we fear a shortage of food, if we can be free and good. The Lord has declared, “… the earth is full, and there is enough and to spare. …” (D&C 104:17.) We can accept this promise with confidence.\nPresident Calvin Coolidge pinpointed the problem some years ago with these words:\n“We do not need more material development, we need more spiritual development. We do not need more intellectual power, we need more moral power. We do not need more knowledge, we need more character. We do not need more government, we need more culture. We do not need more law, we need more religion. We do not need more of the things that are seen, we need more of the things that are unseen. It is on that side of life that it is desirable to put the emphasis at the present time. If that side is strengthened, the other side will take care of itself. It is that side which is the foundation of all else. If the foundation be firm, the superstructure will stand.” ( p. 35.)\nAs a free people, we are following very closely in many respects the pattern which led to the downfall of the great Roman Empire. A group of well-known historians has summarized those conditions leading to the downfall of Rome in these words:\n“… Rome had known a pioneer beginning not unlike our own pioneer heritage, and then entered into two centuries of greatness, reaching its pinnacle in the second of those centuries, going into the decline and collapse in the third. Yet, the sins of decay were becoming apparent in the latter years of that second century.\n“It is written that there were vast increases in the number of the idle rich, and the idle poor. The latter (the idle poor) were put on a permanent dole, a welfare system not unlike our own. As this system became permanent, the recipients of public largesse (welfare) increased in number. They organized into a political block with sizable power. They were not hesitant about making their demands known. Nor was the government hesitant about agreeing to their demands … and with ever-increasing frequency. Would-be emperors catered to them. The great, solid middle class—Rome’s strength then as ours is today—was taxed more and more to support a bureaucracy that kept growing larger, and even more powerful. Surtaxes were imposed upon incomes to meet emergencies. The government engaged in deficit spending. The denarius, a silver coin similar to our half dollar, began to lose its silvery hue. It took on a copper color as the government reduced the silver content.\n“Even then, Gresham’s law was at work, because the real silver coin soon disappeared. It went into hiding.\n“Military service was an obligation highly honored by the Romans. Indeed, a foreigner could win Roman citizenship simply by volunteering for service in the legions of Rome. But, with increasing affluence and opulence, the young men of Rome began avoiding this service, finding excuses to remain in the soft and sordid life of the city. They took to using cosmetics and wearing feminine-like hairdo’s and garments, until it became difficult, the historians tell us, to tell the sexes apart.\n“Among the teachers and scholars was a group called the Cynics whose number let their hair and beards grow, and who wore slovenly clothes, and professed indifference to worldly goods as they heaped scorn on what they called ‘middle class values.’\n“The morals declined. It became unsafe to walk in the countryside or the city streets. Rioting was commonplace and sometimes whole sections of towns and cities were burned.\n“And, all the time, the twin diseases of confiscatory taxation and creeping inflation were waiting to deliver the death blow.\n“Then finally, all these forces overcame the energy and ambition of the middle class.\n“Rome fell.\n“We are now approaching the end of our second century.” (Address by Governor Ronald Reagan of California at Eisenhower College, New York, 1969.)\nIn 1787 Edward Gibbon completed his noble work Here is the way he accounted for the fall:\n\nThe undermining of the dignity and sanctity of the home, which is the basis of human society.\n\nHigher and higher taxes and the spending of public monies for free bread and circuses for the populace.\n\nThe mad craze for pleasure, sports becoming every year more and more exciting and brutal.\n\nThe building of gigantic armaments when the real enemy was within the decadence of the people.\n\nThe decay of religion—faith fading into mere form, losing touch with life, and becoming impotent to warn and guide the people.\n\nIs there a parallel for us in America today? Could the same reasons that destroyed Rome destroy America and possibly other countries of the free world?\nFor eight years in Washington I had this prayerful statement on my desk: “O God, give us men with a mandate higher than the ballot box.”\nThe lessons of history, many of them very sobering, ought to be turned to during this hour of our great achievements, because during the hour of our success is our greatest danger. Even during the hour of our great prosperity, a nation may sow the seeds of its own destruction. History reveals that rarely is a great civilization conquered from without unless it has weakened or destroyed itself within.\nThe lessons of history stand as guideposts to help us safely chart the course for the future.\nAs American citizens, as citizens of the nations of the free world, we need to rouse ourselves to the problems which confront us as great Christian nations. We must recognize that these fundamental, basic principles—moral and spiritual—lay at the very foundation of our past achievements. To continue to enjoy present blessings, we must return to these basic and fundamental principles. Economics and morals are both part of one inseparable body of truth. They must be in harmony. We need to square our actions with these eternal verities.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints stands firm in support of the great spiritual and moral principles which have been the basic traditions of the free world. We oppose every evil effort to downgrade or challenge the eternal verities which have undergirded civilization from the beginning.\nWe will use every honorable means to strengthen the home and family; to encourage obedience to the first and great commandment to multiply and replenish the earth through noble parenthood; and to strengthen character through adherence to high spiritual and moral principles.\nIn The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chastity will never be out of date. We have one standard for men and women, and that standard is moral purity. We oppose and abhor the damnable practice of wholesale abortion and every other unholy and impure act which strikes at the very foundation of the home and family, our most basic institutions.\nA continuation of these immoral practices will surely bring down the wrath and judgments of the Almighty.\nIn our concentration upon materialism and material acquisitions, are we forgetting the spiritual basis upon which our prosperity, security, and freedom rest? God help us to repent of our evil ways and humble ourselves before the offended power.\nThere is great safety in a nation on its knees.\nWhat assurance it would give of the much-needed blessings of the Lord if the American people, and people everywhere, could all be found daily—night and morning—on their knees expressing gratitude for blessings already received, acknowledging our dependence upon God, and seeking his divine guidance.\nThe spectacle of a nation praying is more awe-inspiring, more powerful, than the explosion of an atomic bomb. The force of prayer is greater than any possible combination of man-controlled powers, because “prayer is man’s greatest means of tapping the resources of God.” The Founding Fathers accept this eternal verity. Do we? Will we?\nYes, it is in our own enlightened self-interest to engage in this simple practice, this powerful practice of prayer. Roger Babson said many years ago: “What this country needs more than anything else is old-fashioned family prayer.” Yes, our greatest need is a return to the old-fashioned, time-tested verities.\nGod help us, as free men, to recognize the source of our blessings, the threat to our freedom and our moral and spiritual standards, and the need for humble, yet courageous, action to preserve these priceless, time-tested blessings, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "year": 1973,
        "content": "One of God’s greatest gifts to man is freedom of choice.\nAt an early period in the journey through life, man finds himself at a crossroad where he must choose one of two great highways—the right, leading to progress and happiness; and the wrong, leading to retardation and sorrow. There exists this eternal law that each human soul, through the choices he makes, will shape his own destiny. Our success or failure, peace or discontent, happiness or misery, depend on the choices we make each day.\nAccording to the scriptures, the first and most important question pertaining to the individual was that of freedom of choice. Before the world was, and in a great council in heaven, God the Father presented his plan to organize and people the earth.\nHe explained that his spirit children would go to earth, gain bodies of flesh and blood, be tried and tested in all things to see if they would keep all of his commandments, and prepare to come back to his eternal presence.\nLucifer, a son of the morning, came forth with his plan to redeem all mankind by force, that not one soul would be lost, for which he wanted the honor. Then Christ presented his plan, which was to follow the will of the Father and allow all men to choose for themselves, and the glory would go to the Father. Christ’s plan was accepted, and all who come to dwell upon the earth in bodies of flesh and blood elected in that great council to follow Jesus Christ.\nSatan rebelled and influenced a third of the hosts of heaven to follow him.\nAs recorded in Moses, God said:\n“Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I should give unto him mine own power; by the power of mine Only Begotten, I caused that he should be cast down;\n“And he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto my voice.” (Moses 4:3–4. Italics added.)\nAt that time, Satan, with his followers, committed himself to destroy our free agency and the cause of righteousness. He began his nefarious work in the Garden of Eden by successfully tempting Adam and Eve to partake of the forbidden fruit. God had said:\n“Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat,\n“But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee. …” (Moses 3:16–17. Italics added.)\nWhile Satan is determined to destroy us, the Savior says: “… this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.” (Moses 1:39.)\nHe gave his life so that all mankind might enjoy immortality; and through his gospel and the teachings of the prophets, both ancient and modern, we are given a clear understanding of the purpose of life and how to distinguish right from wrong, with promises of salvation and exaltation to all who keep the commandments. But remember that Satan has committed himself to destroy mankind and is continually at work to accomplish this one thing. The scriptures tell us:\n“Satan stirreth them up, that he may lead their souls to destruction.\n“And thus he has laid a cunning plan, thinking to destroy the work of God; …\n“And … he … leadeth them along until he draggeth their souls down to hell; …\n“And thus he goeth up and down, to and fro in the earth, seeking to destroy the souls of men.” (D&C 10:22–23, 26–27.)\nThe reality of Satan and the power and influence he wields have been evident since that first temptation in the Garden of Eden. He influenced Cain to slay his brother Abel, which resulted in great suffering and sorrow. The Book of Mormon is replete with examples of the destruction of individuals and groups who refused to follow the teachings of the Lord and instead succumbed to the influence of Satan.\nNow, in the Bible we have the story of the great flood, when, because of the wickedness of the people, none but Noah and his family were spared. We know what happened to the great cities of Sodom and Gomorrah because the people chose to follow Satan. In secular history we read of the fall of the Roman Empire; and accounts are too numerous to mention of the destruction of other civilizations, cities, and individuals who chose to turn away from the Lord.\nIn a recent challenging speech, which was titled “Who Is Tampering with the Soul of America?” Jenkin Lloyd Jones said the pathway of history is littered with the bones of dead states and fallen empires. He points out that Rome did not fall because its walls were low, but because Rome itself was low. The sensuality, orgies, and gradually weakened fibre of a once self-disciplined people brought Rome down. (Speech delivered to the American Society of Newspaper Editors.)\nWith all of these examples, what more or greater evidence do we need to convince us that when we choose evil rather than good, we lose our freedom and become the slaves of those who would destroy us and deprive us of the blessings attendant upon righteousness? As we make our choices each day, we must keep in mind that as we sow, so shall we reap. We cannot sow seeds of iniquity and reap a harvest of blessings. Let me relate a story to illustrate.\nA certain man, well up on the ladder of success, had great prospects for a very bright future. Then one day at a businessmen’s luncheon he decided that social drinking would make him more popular and successful. He soon began looking forward to the cocktail hours, and then found they didn’t come often enough. Finally he became an alcoholic, lost his job, his wife, and his friends. Because of the wrong choice at a moment of decision, he had lost everything he once so hopefully and diligently set out to accomplish.\nOn the other hand, we have the examples of Joseph, who was sold into Egypt; of Moses, who led the Israelites from bondage; of Daniel, through whom the Lord gave marvelous prophecies and predictions and of whom it was said, as he was taken from the lion’s den: “… no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.” (Dan. 6:23.) They, with many others, had the courage to say no to temptation and to choose the right, and thereby save themselves and their people from destruction.\nSelf-discipline is essential in helping us make proper choices. It is much easier to drift than to row, to slide downhill than to climb up. Satan is constantly at work to drag us down by placing temptations in our way in the form of alcohol, tobacco, drugs, pornography, deceit, dishonesty, and flattery, always waiting to catch us in our misdeeds.\nHow can we combat the evil that surrounds us and which is so prevalent in the world today? Satan is trying harder than ever before to claim souls for his own domain. We must and we can thwart him, but only by choosing to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ and making our influence an active and positive force. As leaders, as parents, as teachers, and as neighbors, all good people everywhere who are striving for liberty and freedom, peace, success, happiness, and for eternal life with our Father in heaven must by example and precept be actively engaged in fighting against those forces which are threatening us and endangering our well-being and that of our children.\nDon’t let us be fooled or misled by the claim extant in the world today that restraints and conventions are damaging to the psyche of a child. In promoting a permissive and unrestricted society, they would have a child undisciplined for misbehavior. This is a false premise, and we are better advised to heed the counsel of the Lord when he said:\n“And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents.\n“And they shall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord.” (D&C 68:25, 28.)\nChildren do not learn by themselves how to distinguish right from wrong. Parents have to determine the child’s readiness to assume responsibility and his capacity to make sound decisions, to evaluate alternatives, and the results of doing so. While we are teaching them, we have the responsibility to discipline them and to see that they do what is right. If a child is besmudged with dirt, we do not let him wait until he grows up to decide whether or not he will bathe. We do not let him wait to decide whether or not he will take his medicine when sick, or go to school or to church. By example, persuasion, and love we see that he does what we know is best for him. We cannot overemphasize the importance of example. The late J. Edgar Hoover said that if fathers and mothers would take their children to Sunday School and church regularly, they could strike a felling blow against the forces that contribute to juvenile delinquency.\nParents also should teach their children early in life the glorious concept and fact that they are spirit children of God, and that choosing to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ is the only way to enjoy success and happiness here and eternal life hereafter. They must be taught that Satan is real and that he will use all agencies at his disposal to tempt them to do wrong, to lead them astray, make them his captives, and keep them from the supreme happiness and exaltation they could otherwise enjoy.\nTo meet the serious issues facing us in our respective communities today, we must be examples of virtue and righteousness ourselves and choose today to take our stand on the moral issues which threaten us. We do not want our civilization to decay and fall because we failed to keep it on a high spiritual plane and allowed it to sink to the level where the animal instincts and passions dominate.\nLet me refer again to Jenkin Lloyd Jones. He said that we are suffering from a collapse of moral standards and the blunting of our capacity for righteous indignation. Then, referring to our Puritan ancestors, he said: “For all their exaggerated attention to sin, their philosophy rested on a great granite rock. Man was the master of his soul. You didn’t have to be bad. You could and should be better. And if you wanted to escape the eternal fires, you’d well better be.”\nThen concerning our present-day entertainment he said:\n“Can anyone deny that movies are dirtier than ever? But they don’t call it dirt. They call it ‘realism.’ Why do we let them fool us? Why do we nod owlishly when they tell us that filth is merely a daring art form, that licentiousness is really social comment? Isn’t it plain that the financially-harassed movie industry is putting gobs of sex in the darkened drive-ins in an effort to lure curious teenagers away? … Last week the screen industry solemnly announced that henceforth perversion and homosexuality would no longer be barred from the screen provided the subjects were handled with ‘delicacy and taste.’” What nonsense!\n“We are drowning our youngsters in violence, cynicism, and sadism piped into the living room and even the nursery. The grandchildren of the kids who used to weep because The Little Match Girl froze to death now feel cheated if she isn’t slugged, raped, and thrown into a Bessemer converter. …\n“The quick-buck boys have apparently convinced our bumfuzzled judges that there is no difference between a peep show and a moral lecture.\n“… We have reached the point where we should re-examine the debilitating philosophy of permissiveness. Let this not be confused with the philosophy of liberty. …\n“It’s time we hit the sawdust trail. It’s time we revived the idea that there is such a thing as sin—just plain old willful sin. It is time we brought self-discipline back into style.”\nIt is also time we realized that these are all Satan’s ways of destroying mankind. Now, what must we do? If there is pornography or obscenity in bookstores, on television or radio, or in places of entertainment, if there are those who would make more easily available to the young and inexperienced alcohol and its attendant evils, including drunken driving, highway fatalities, broken homes, and if we are threatened with the passage of laws which violate the commandments of God, it is our duty and responsibility as individuals to speak out, to organize, and to protect ourselves and our community against such encroachments. We have seen how people react to the high price of food. It is far more important that we react effectively against the immorality and evil in our communities which threaten the morals and the very lives of our children. As President Nixon has said, the only way to attack crime in America is the way crime attacks the people—without pity.\nPeople who argue that they have constitutional rights and want to use what they call their free agency to accomplish unrighteous ends abuse the idea of free agency and deprive others of their constitutional rights. While many of our problems are caused by those who are deliberately trying to further their own selfish and devilish interests, there is also a vocal, misled minority which is responsible for other problems as they exist in our country and in our communities. We must be equally vocal and firm in our efforts to maintain the quality of our surroundings, where we can enjoy family solidarity, which is the strength of any nation. We must take a firm stand against the concerted efforts in many areas to destroy the family unit.\nAs we contemplate these devastating conditions rampant in the world today—the wars, death, suffering, poverty, and disease—and while many question why God permits such troublous conditions to plague us, let us remember that man himself is responsible. Even though the innocent suffer with the wicked in many instances, all the strife and contention and wickedness abroad in the land today is because man has chosen to follow Satan instead of accepting and living according to the teachings of Jesus Christ. From the beginning we have been told that there must be opposition in all things in order that we might progress according to God’s plan for us. Again we turn to the scriptures:\n“For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so, … righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad. …\n“Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other.\n“Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great mediation of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.” (2 Ne. 2:11, 16, 27.)\nMen are not created to be miserable, for “men are, that they might have joy.” (2 Ne. 2:25.) To assist us and guide us in our choices, to counteract the forces of Satan, and to give us the joy and happiness for which we are all seeking, God has seen fit through his Son Jesus Christ to reestablish upon the earth in these, the latter days, his church and kingdom, with the restored gospel in its fullness. He has reestablished the priesthood, which is the power to act in God’s name, with a prophet through whom God speaks to direct us. I join with thousands of others in bearing witness to all the world that the gospel alone offers the only true way to happiness and peace which passeth understanding, and eternal life to all who will accept it and keep the commandments.\nYes, every day of our lives we are determining by our choices whether we shall reap good or evil, whether salvation or destruction, whether eternal life with our Father or the utter despair at being cast out from his presence. Each day we choose whether or not we believe in God the Eternal Father and in his Son Jesus Christ, and whether or not we will accept their teachings and keep the commandments.\nWe choose whether or not we will accept President Harold B. Lee as a prophet of God, listen to his voice, and follow him, in the sure knowledge that he is the mouthpiece of the Lord and the leader of God’s children on the earth today. We choose whether or not we are prepared to accept and live by the Articles of Faith and be honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, honorable and upright in our dealings with our fellowmen, showing our love for them by being good neighbors. As we choose to seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, we can know that all other things for our good will be added unto us.\nWe cannot go astray if we listen to the prophet’s voice and follow him, and as we do so we will be led in the path of truth and righteousness and enjoy the love, respect, and confidence of our fellowmen, and eventually enjoy eternal life with our Father in heaven. Or we may refuse and lose all these great blessings.\n“Nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself.”\nMay we choose wisely, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "Some 23 years ago I was called as a young man to serve as the bishop of a large ward in Salt Lake City. The magnitude of the calling was overwhelming and the responsibility frightening. My inadequacy humbled me. But my Heavenly Father did not leave me to wander in darkness and in silence, uninstructed or uninspired. In his own way he revealed the lessons he would have me learn.\nOne evening at a late hour my telephone rang. I heard a voice say, “Bishop Monson, this is the hospital calling. Kathleen McKee, a member of your congregation, has just passed away. Our records reveal that she had no next of kin, but your name is listed as the one to be notified in the event of her death. Could you come to the hospital right away?”\nUpon arriving there, I was presented with a sealed envelope which contained a key to the modest apartment in which Kathleen McKee had lived. A childless widow 73 years of age, she had enjoyed but few of life’s luxuries and possessed scarcely sufficient of its necessities. In the twilight of her life she had become a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Being a quiet and overly reserved person, little was known about her life.\nThat same night I entered her tidy basement apartment, turned the light switch, and in a moment discovered a letter written ever so meticulously in Kathleen McKee’s own hand. It rested face up on a small table and read:\n“Bishop Monson,\n“I think I shall not return from the hospital. In the dresser drawer is a small insurance policy which will cover funeral expenses. The furniture may be given to my neighbors.\n“In the kitchen are my three precious canaries. Two of them are beautiful, yellow-gold in color, and are perfectly marked. On their cages I have noted the names of friends to whom they are to be given. In the third cage is ‘Billie.’ He is my favorite. Billie looks a bit scrubby, and his yellow hue is marred by gray on his wings. Will you and your family make a home for him? He isn’t the prettiest, but his song is the best.”\nIn the days that followed, I learned much more about Kathleen McKee. She had befriended many neighbors in need. She had given cheer and comfort almost daily to a cripple who lived down the street. Indeed, she had brightened each life she touched. Kathleen McKee was much like “Billie,” her prized yellow canary with gray on its wings. She was not blessed with beauty, gifted with poise, nor honored by posterity. Yet her song helped others to more willingly bear their burdens and more ably shoulder their tasks. She lived the message of the verse:\n\n“Go, gladden the lonely, the dreary;\nGo, comfort the weeping, the weary;\nGo, scatter kind deeds on your way;\nOh, make the world brighter today!”\n\n— 1909, No. 197\n\nThe world is filled with yellow canaries with gray on their wings. The pity is that so precious few of them have learned to sing. Perhaps the clear notes of proper example have not sounded in their ears or found lodgment in their hearts.\nSome are young people who don’t know who they are, what they can be or even want to be. They are afraid, but they don’t know of what. They are angry, but they don’t know at whom. They are rejected, and they don’t know why. All they want is to be somebody.\nOthers are stooped with age, burdened with care, or filled with doubt—living lives far below the level of their capacities.\nAll of us are prone to excuse our own mediocre performance. We blame our misfortunes, our disfigurements, or our so-called handicaps. Victims of our own rationalization, we say silently to ourselves: “I’m just too weak,” or “I’m not cut out for better things.” Others soar beyond our meager accomplishments. Envy and discouragement then take their toll.\nCan we not appreciate that our very business in life is not to get ahead of others, but to get ahead of ourselves? To break our own records, to outstrip our yesterdays by our todays, to bear our trials more beautifully than we ever dreamed we could, to give as we have never given, to do our work with more force and a finer finish than ever—this is the true idea: to get ahead of ourselves.\nTo live greatly, we must develop the capacity to face trouble with courage, disappointment with cheerfulness, and triumph with humility. You ask, “How might we achieve these goals?” I answer, “By getting a true perspective of who we really are!” We are sons and daughters of a living God, in whose image we have been created. Think of that truth: “Created in the image of God.” We cannot sincerely hold this conviction without experiencing a profound new sense of strength and power, even the strength to live the commandments of God, the power to resist the temptations of Satan.\nTrue, we live in a world where moral character ofttimes is relegated to a position secondary to facial beauty or personal charm. We read and hear of local, national, and international beauty contests. Throngs pay tribute to Miss America, Miss World, and Miss Universe. Athletic prowess, too, has its following. The winter games, the world Olympics, the tournaments of international scope bring forth the adoring applause of the enthralled crowd. Such are the ways of men!\nBut what are the inspired words of God? From a time of long ago the counsel of Samuel the prophet echoes in our ears: “… the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.” (1 Sam. 16:7.)\nSham and hypocrisy found no place with the King of kings and the Lord of lords. He denounced the scribes and Pharisees for their vanity and shallow lives, their pretense and feigned righteousness. He called them “whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men’s bones.” (Matt. 23:27.)\nThey, like the beautiful yellow canaries, were outwardly handsome, but a true song came not from their hearts.\nTo their counterparts on this continent God’s prophet declared: “For behold, ye do love money, and your substance, and your fine apparel, and the adorning of your churches, more than ye love the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted. …\n“Why are ye ashamed to take upon you the name of Christ? …\n“Why do ye adorn yourselves with that which hath no life, and yet suffer the hungry, and the needy, and the naked, and the sick and the afflicted to pass by you, and notice them not?” (Morm. 8:37–39.)\nThe Master could be found mingling with the poor, the downtrodden, the oppressed, and the afflicted. He brought hope to the hopeless, strength to the weak, and freedom to the captive. He taught of the better life to come—even eternal life. This knowledge ever directs those who receive the divine injunction: “Follow thou me.” It guided Peter. It motivated Paul. It can determine our personal destiny. Can we make the decision to follow in righteousness and truth the Redeemer of the world? With his help a rebellious boy can become an obedient man, a wayward girl can cast aside the old self and begin anew. Indeed, the gospel of Jesus Christ can change men’s lives.\nIn his epistle to the Corinthians, the apostle Paul taught: “… God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty.” (1 Cor. 1:27.)\nWhen the Savior sought a man of faith, he did not select him from the throng of self-righteous who were found regularly in the synagogue. Rather, he called him from among the fishermen of Capernaum.\nWhile teaching on the seashore, he saw two ships standing by the lake. He entered one and asked its owner to put it out a little from the land so he might not be pressed upon by the crowd. After teaching further, he said to Simon, “Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets.”\nSimon answered: “Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net. And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes. … When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.” (Luke 5:4–6, 8.)\nCame the reply: “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.” (Matt. 4:19.) Simon the fisherman had received his call. Doubting, disbelieving, unschooled, untrained, impetuous Simon did not find the way of the Lord a highway of ease nor a path free from pain. He was to hear the rebuke: “O thou of little faith” (Matt. 14:31), and likewise the denunciation, “Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me” (Matt. 16:23). Yet, when the Master asked him, “… whom say ye that I am?” Peter answered: “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.” (Matt. 16:15–16.)\nSimon, man of doubt, had become Peter, apostle of faith. A yellow canary with gray on his wings qualified for the Master’s full confidence and abiding love.\nWhen the Savior was to choose a missionary of zeal and power, he found him not among his advocates but amidst his adversaries. Saul of Tarsus made havoc of the church and breathed out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord. But this was before the experience of Damascus Way. Of Saul, the Lord declared: “… he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel: … I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name’s sake.” (Acts 9:15–16.)\nSaul the persecutor became Paul the proselyter. Like the yellow canary with gray on his wings, Paul, too, had his blemishes. He himself said: “And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me. … For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. …” (2 Cor. 12:7–9.)\nBoth Paul and Peter were to expend their strength and forfeit their lives in the cause of truth. The Redeemer chose imperfect men to teach the way to perfection. He did so then. He does so now—even yellow canaries with gray on their wings.\nHe calls you and me to serve him here below and sets us to the tasks he would have us fulfill. The commitment is total. There is no conflict of conscience. And in our struggle, should we stumble, then let us plead: “Lead us, oh lead us, great Molder of men; out of the darkness to strive once again.” (From the “Fight Song,” Yonkers High School.)\nOur appointed task may appear insignificant, unnecessary, unnoticed. We may be tempted to question:\n\n“‘Father, where shall I work today?’\nAnd my love flowed warm and free.\nThen he pointed out a tiny spot\nAnd said, ‘Tend that for me.’\nI answered quickly, ‘Oh no, not that!\nWhy, no one would ever see,\nNo matter how well my work was done.\nNot that little place for me.’\nAnd the word he spoke, it was not stern;\nHe answered me tenderly:\n‘Ah, little one, search that heart of thine;\nArt thou working for them or for me?\n‘Nazareth was a little place,\nAnd so was Galilee.’”\n\n—Meade MacGuire\n\nMy prayer today is that we indeed will follow the Man of Galilee. May we praise his name, and so order our lives as to reflect our love. May we ever remember that to us God our Father gave his Son, and that for us Jesus Christ gave his life. I testify that he lives and pray we may be worthy of such a divine gift, in the name of Jesus Christ the Lord. Amen."

        "year": 1973,
        "content": "During the few minutes that I am before you, I would like to address my remarks to those who are not of this faith; and since we are all the children of God, I would like to refer to you as my brothers and sisters.\nWith the approach of the Easter season, the world takes note of the greatest event known to mankind. The literalness of the death and burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ lifts him above the status of a great man or an inspired leader. To overcome death for all mankind, Jesus Christ had to be the Son of God and the Redeemer and Savior of the world.\nTo members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, this miraculous event has double meaning. For there are two sources to which we can look for an account of the resurrection. The one, of course, is the Holy Bible. Who can help but gain peace and reassurance from the words of John which say, “Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live” (John 11:25), or the words of Mark describing the experience of those going to the tomb after the death of the Savior: “And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted. And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him” (Mark 16:5–6).\nFollowing these experiences in the land of the Bible, another people in a far-off land, a remnant of the house of Israel who also had prophets and kept their own scriptural record, recorded the following concerning the resurrected Lord:\n“And it came to pass, as they understood they cast their eyes up again towards heaven; and behold, they saw a Man descending out of heaven; and he was clothed in a white robe; and he came down and stood in the midst of them; and the eyes of the whole multitude were turned upon him, and they durst not open their mouths, even one to another, and wist not what it meant, for they thought it was an angel that had appeared unto them.\n“And it came to pass that he stretched forth his hand and spake unto the people, saying:\n“Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world.\n“And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning.” (3 Ne. 11:8–11.)\nA second evidence then is recorded to verify what was mentioned in the Holy Bible concerning the resurrection of the Savior. This second witness for Christ can be found in the volume of scripture known as the Book of Mormon. It is a compilation of the writings of the prophets of God who were part of the great civilization which lived anciently in the Americas. These prophets taught the gospel of Jesus Christ as did their counterparts in the Holy Land, and they spoke of the birth and life of the Savior and also of his death and resurrection—although these events would transpire in another part of the world.\nThe highlight of this great record was when the resurrected Savior appeared to these people and taught them the same gospel and the principles of salvation that he had presented to those who were his disciples in the Holy Land. It was only a matter of three generations from that time, however, when the people had almost entirely rejected the teachings of Jesus Christ. They had become warlike and even rejected the prophets.\nOne of the last prophets to live was a man by the name of Mormon, who took all of the records and abridged them. For this reason the volume is known as the Book of Mormon. Mormon passed the sacred records to his son Moroni, who was one of the last followers of Christ in that generation, himself being a hunted man because of his beliefs. It was made known to Moroni and to other prophets that the Lord would bring this record forward in a later generation of time, to testify of the events that took place in Jerusalem and to convince mankind that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that there is a plan whereby man can be saved and receive eternal life.\nBeing commanded of the Lord, the prophet Moroni buried the record in a hill, and there it remained until the year 1827, when a young man by the name of Joseph Smith was shown by a divine messenger where the record was hidden and was given power to translate it so that the world might have a second evidence that the basic truths of the Bible are correct.\nThere were witnesses to the translation of these plates. In a joint statement Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris gave the following testimony: “Be It Known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom this work shall come: That we, through the grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, have seen the plates which contain this record, … And we also know that they have been translated by the gift and power of God, for his voice hath declared it unto us; wherefore we know of a surety that the work is true.” (Book of Mormon: The Testimony of the Three Witnesses.)\nThe reason for the Book of Mormon coming forth in this generation of time can be found on the title page of the book, which is part of the translated record and which says in part, “And also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations.” The Book of Mormon, then, is a means whereby men can be convinced that God lives and that Jesus Christ is his Son and Savior of the world.\nThis book, then, bears record of the divine Sonship of Jesus Christ and recognizes him as Redeemer of the world. This passage from 3rd Nephi in the Book of Mormon is a good example:\n“Behold, I am Jesus Christ the Son of God. I created the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are. …\n“Behold, I have come unto the world to bring redemption unto the world, to save the world from sin.\n“Therefore, whoso repenteth and cometh unto me as a little child, him will I receive, for of such is the kingdom of God. Behold, for such I have laid down my life, and have taken it up again; therefore repent, and come unto me ye ends of the earth, and be saved.” (3 Ne. 9:15, 21–22.)\nA second message of the Book of Mormon is to teach mankind the plan of salvation in its pure and basic form so that we might know what the Lord expects of us in order to be saved. Again, an example of this can be found from the words of the Savior in 3rd Nephi, which are as follows:\n“And this is my doctrine, and it is the doctrine which the Father hath given unto me; … and I bear record that the Father commandeth all men, everywhere, to repent and believe in me.\n“And whoso believeth in me, and is baptized, the same shall be saved; and they are they who shall inherit the kingdom of God.” (3 Ne. 11:32–33.)\nAt the same time the Savior spoke these words, he also commissioned certain disciples with specific authority to perform the baptism just spoken of. He also explained what he meant by repentance and what steps must be taken in order to gain this repentance.\nAnd finally, if the Book of Mormon is true, then it must attest to the fact that Joseph Smith, the translator of this record, was a prophet of God and was divinely inspired to bring forth this work. In the revelation concerning the coming forth of the Book of Mormon the Lord referred to Joseph Smith in the following way: “… he has translated the book, even that part which I have commanded him, and as your Lord and your God liveth it is true.” (D&C 17:6.)\nJoseph Smith once made the statement that the Book of Mormon was the keystone of this religion, that a person could get closer to God by following its precepts than by any other book. Joseph Smith has long since passed away. But The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Book of Mormon live on as a sign and witness to all nations that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that there is a way to return to the presence of God and that the basic truths of the Holy Bible are correct.\nRealizing that there would be those who might say, “Yes, but how can we know?”—the last prophet to write in the book gave this promise to all who want to know and in these words:\n“Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts.\n“And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.\n“And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.” (Moro. 10:3–5.)\nThis promise is made, then, to all who want to know, that if they will read these things and ponder them in their hearts and do it prayerfully, the truth will be made known unto them.\nToday the Church is known as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to distinguish it from the church of Jesus Christ that existed at the time of the New Testament and the Book of Mormon.\nAs in the ancient church, it has apostles and prophets at the head, and it teaches that all mankind can be saved through obedience to the principles and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nWe believe that the Savior literally leads his church through direct and continuous revelation to its leaders. We believe too that all mankind are the sons and daughters of God and that if they will prayerfully and honestly seek him, he will bless them with a realization of the truthfulness of these things. We believe that Jesus Christ will come again to the earth, and when he does, he will reign as King of kings, as the resurrected Lord and as the Prince of Peace.\nTo this I bear my humble witness that I know God lives and that Jesus the Christ is his Son, and that this work is true, for the Lord God has revealed it to me. And if we are the children of God, then all men can and should have this experience, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "On the evening of his betrayal, Jesus met with his Twelve Apostles in an upper room guest chamber in Jerusalem to observe the annual Feast of the Passover.\nPreviously, Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, had bargained with the chief priests and had agreed to betray the Lord for a price of 30 pieces of silver. Jesus, being aware of this treachery, sat at the table with the Twelve. He said sorrowfully: “Verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.” (Matt. 26:21.)\nAfter they had eaten, Jesus blessed the bread and wine and in a simple but impressive manner instituted the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper.\nA beautiful, inspirational discourse was then delivered by the Savior, who concluded the sermon with a prayer. Before they left the guest chamber in the building, a hymn or psalm was sung. Then Jesus and the 11 apostles departed. Judas had previously left the group to meet the enemies of Christ.\nJesus and his associates passed through one of the several gates in the wall of Jerusalem, crossed over the brook called Cedron, and entered an olive orchard, known as Gethsemane, on the slope of Mount Olivet. This was a favorite meeting place for the Lord and his apostles.\nEntering the garden, Jesus asked eight of the apostles to remain behind; then with Peter, James, and John, he went a short distance, where he requested them to wait and watch. Going on alone a little ways, he knelt and prayed to his Father, saying: “O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me [but then came this beautiful lesson]; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.” (Matt. 26:39.)\nThree times he prayed, and we read: “And being in agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling to the ground.” (Luke 22:44.)\nElder James E. Talmage, a member of the Twelve in our dispensation, made this observation: “Christ’s agony in the garden is unfathomable to the finite mind, both as to intensity and cause. The thought that He suffered through fear of death is untenable. Death to Him was preliminary to resurrection and triumphal return to the Father from whom He had come, and to a state of glory even beyond what He had before possessed; and, moreover, it was within His power to lay down His life voluntarily.” Then Elder Talmage testifies: “In some manner, actual and terribly real, though to man incomprehensible, the Savior took upon Himself the burden of the sins of mankind from Adam to the end of the world.” ( p. 613.)\nFollowing the Savior’s crucifixion and resurrection came the long dark night of the apostasy. Finally the heavens were reopened and the voice of the Lord was heard again on the earth. The gospel and priesthood were restored, and the church of Jesus Christ was reestablished in these latter days. Then from the Lord came this admonition to the members of the Church: “And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day.” (D&C 59:9.)\nAnd then the Lord further instructed: “It is expedient that the Church meet together often to partake of bread and wine in the remembrance of the Lord Jesus.” (D&C 20:75.)\nIn these words was the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper authorized in our day, the dispensation of the fulness of times. The bread and water, duly consecrated by prayer, become emblems of the Lord’s body and blood, to be partaken of reverently and in remembrance of him.\nThe sacrament is a sacred and solemn service. As we partake of the sacrament, we make covenants with the Lord. This is not unusual, because Latter-day Saints are a covenant-making people.\nThere are few set prayers in the Church, and the sacramental prayers, which came from the Lord by revelation, are two of them. We should listen attentively as the prayers are given and realize—\nFirst, that the bread and water are in remembrance of the body and blood which the Savior shed for us;\nSecondly, that we pledge to take upon ourselves the name of the Lord Jesus;\nThirdly, that we will keep the commandments that he has given us; and,\nFourthly, that we promise we will always remember him.\nThere is one part of the prayer that I should like to emphasize. It is this: “that we will always remember him.”\nOf what do we think when we remember Jesus Christ, the Savior?\nDo we think or remember that he is a member of the Godhead or Trinity, together with God our Eternal Father and the Holy Ghost, the three personages comprising the great presiding council of the universe?\nDo we recall that Jesus was the Creator of this world and the chief executive in carrying out the wishes of the Father? John the Beloved, who referred to the Savior as “the Word,” gives this testimony: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\n“The same was in the beginning with God.\n“All things were made by him; and without him was not anything made that was made.” (John 1:1–3.)\nDo we remember that at the great council in the heavens in which we participated as preexistent spiritual beings, he presented a plan in which he offered his life, and that he was willing to suffer death to atone for the sins that would come into the world? In doing this he would assure us of a resurrection from the dead, and he would make salvation possible for us, his brothers and sisters, and thus become our Savior.\nDo we remember his intense agony and suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane, as he took upon himself the sins of mankind?\nAs we partake of the sacrament, do we remember that we enjoy membership in the restored church which bears his name; do we resolve that we will strive to demonstrate our appreciation by responding to calls and assignments made by our leaders; and do we commit ourselves to do everything within our power to help build up his church?\nAnd, finally, do we remember the promises and assurances given to us by the Savior, that he will return once again, in what is referred to as his second coming? Do we remember that those who are faithful and keep his commandments may again have the privilege of entering his presence and that of our Father in heaven?\nWe learn, then, from the beautiful sacramental prayers that, first, the bread and water are taken in remembrance of the body and of the blood that the Savior shed for us; secondly, that we pledge to take upon us the name of the Lord Jesus Christ; and thirdly, we promise that we will always remember him, and that we will keep the commandments which he has given us. And if we do these things, we are then in a position to realize the meaningful promise: “that we may always have his Spirit to be with us.”\n\nWhat a wonderful blessing it would be if we could always have the Spirit of the Savior in our lives to guide and direct us!\nWhile Wilford Woodruff was crossing the ocean on his final mission to Great Britain, he testified that the martyred Prophet, Joseph Smith, and his brother Hyrum appeared to him in his cabin aboard the ship. The vessel had been caught in a terrible storm, which had abated as a result of the prayers of the brethren. Hear Brother Woodruff’s own words of what happened: “The night following [the storm] Joseph and Hyrum visited me, and the Prophet laid before me a great many things. Among other things, he told me to get the Spirit of God, as we all needed it.”\nMany years later Brigham Young, after his death, also appeared to Brother Woodruff and said virtually the same thing—the importance of gaining and keeping the Spirit of the Lord in our lives.\nOne of the surest ways to obtain and retain the Spirit of the Lord is to so live and keep ourselves unspotted from the sins of the world that we can partake worthily of the Lord’s Supper each week as we attend our sacrament meetings.\nThat we may do this and thus obtain the blessings predicated upon this law, is my humble prayer, which I ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "My beloved associates in this great work, I never come into this Tabernacle without thinking of the devotion and sacrifice of our pioneer fathers who constructed it as a house of God. They dedicated and consecrated it to worship and the teaching of truth. A great and sacred trust is placed in us, as we occupy this pulpit, to speak words of faith. To that end I humbly seek the direction of the Holy Spirit.\nMine has been the opportunity to meet many wonderful men and women in various parts of the world. A few of them have left an indelible impression upon me. One such was a naval officer from Asia, a brilliant young man who had been brought to the United States for advanced training. Some of his associates in the United States Navy, whose behavior had attracted him, shared with him at his request their religious beliefs. He was not a Christian, but he was interested. They told him of the Savior of the world, of Jesus born in Bethlehem, who gave his life for all mankind. They told him of the appearance of God, the Eternal Father, and the resurrected Lord to the boy Joseph Smith. They spoke of modern prophets. They taught him the gospel of the Master. The Spirit touched his heart, and he was baptized.\nHe was introduced to me just before he was to return to his native land. We spoke of these things, and then I said, “Your people are not Christians. You come from a land where Christians have had a difficult time. What will happen when you return home a Christian and, more particularly, a Mormon Christian?”\nHis face clouded, and he replied, “My family will be disappointed. I suppose they will cast me out. They will regard me as dead. As for my future and my career, I assume that all opportunity will be foreclosed against me.”\nI asked, “Are you willing to pay so great a price for the gospel?”\nHis dark eyes, moistened by tears, shone from his handsome brown face as he answered, “It’s true, isn’t it?”\nAshamed at having asked the question, I responded, “Yes, it’s true.”\nTo which he replied, “Then what else matters?”\nThese are the questions I should like to leave with you this morning: “It’s true, isn’t it? Then what else matters?”\nYesterday the growth statistics of the Church were presented. They are impressive and gratifying. They called to mind a recent broadcast of one of the nation’s popular television programs in which Joe Garragiola interviewed the Reverend Dean M. Kelley of the National Council of Churches, who spoke of the declining membership of some of the larger, well-known religious bodies and also of the accelerating growth of others. He gave as the reason for the decline: “Because they have become permissive; they allow just anybody to become members or remain members. They don’t insist on any rigorous requirements of belief or of contributions.” He pointed out, on the other hand, that those groups which require sacrifice of time and effort and means are enjoying vigorous growth.\nHe then went on to say: “The fastest growing church [of] over a million members in this country is the Mormon Church, the Latter-day Saints, with headquarters in Salt Lake City, which is growing at five percent a year, [and] that’s a very rapid increase.”\nThis is a most striking commentary, and one that should concern every thoughtful man and woman. One thing that it says is that a religion which requires devotion, which asks for sacrifice, which demands discipline, also enjoys the loyalty of its membership and the interest and respect of others.\nIt was ever thus. The Savior did not equivocate when he said to Nicodemus: “Except a man be born of the water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” (John 3:5.) There were no exceptions. There was no permissiveness in complying with the rule. It was so in other matters of which he spoke.\nPaul never hedged nor quibbled when setting forth the requirements of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is so today. The Lord himself declared that “strait is the gate and narrow is the way.” Any system dealing with the eternal consequences of human behavior must set guidelines and adhere to them, and no system can long command the loyalties of men that does not expect of them certain measures of discipline, and particularly of self-discipline. The cost in comfort may be great. The sacrifice may be real. But this very demanding reality is the substance of which come character and strength and nobility.\nPermissiveness never produced greatness. Integrity, loyalty, strength are virtues whose sinews are developed through the struggles that go on within a man as he practices self-discipline under the demands of divinely spoken truth.\nBut there is another side of the coin, without which this self-discipline is little more than an exercise. Discipline imposed for the sake of discipline is repressive. It is not in the spirit of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is usually enforced by fear, and its results are negative.\nBut that which is positive, which comes of personal conviction, builds and lifts and strengthens in a marvelous manner. In matters of religion, when a man is motivated by great and powerful convictions of truth, then he disciplines himself, not because of demands made upon him by the Church but because of the knowledge within his heart that God lives; that he is a child of God with an eternal and limitless potential; that there is joy in service and satisfaction in laboring in a great cause.\nThe remarkable progress of this church, to which the Reverend Kelley referred, is not so much the result of the requirements of the Church upon its members as it is the result of the conviction in the hearts of those members that this is in very deed the work of God, and that happiness and peace and satisfaction are found in righteous service.\nWe are gathered today on Temple Square in this historic Tabernacle, surrounded by other remarkable buildings, but the strength of the Church is not in these buildings, nor in its thousands of houses of worship across the world, nor in its universities and hospitals. These are all facilities, desirable, means to an end, but only auxiliary to that which is the true strength. As President Lee indicated yesterday, the strength of this church lies in the hearts of its people, in the individual testimony and conviction of the truth of this work. When an individual has that witness and testimony, the requirements of the Church become challenges rather than burdens. Declared the Savior: “… my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” (Matt. 11:30.)\nThe yoke of Church responsibility, the burden of Church leadership become opportunities rather than problems to him who wears the mantle of dedicated membership in the Church of Jesus Christ.\n\nWhile attending a conference in the East the other day, I listened to the experience of an engineer who joined the Church some months ago. The missionaries had called at his home, and his wife had invited them in. She had eagerly responded to their message, while he felt himself being pulled in against his will. One evening she indicated that she wished to be baptized. He flew into a fit of anger. Didn’t she know what this meant? This would mean time. This would mean the payment of tithing. This would mean giving up their friends. This would mean no more smoking. He threw on his coat, walked out into the night, slamming the door behind him. He walked the streets, swearing at his wife, swearing at the missionaries, swearing at himself for ever permitting them to teach them. As he grew tired, his anger cooled, and a spirit of prayer somehow came into his heart. He prayed as he walked. He pleaded with God for an answer to his questions. And then an impression, clear and unequivocal, came almost as if a voice had spoken with words that said, “It’s true.”\n“It’s true,” he said to himself again and again. “It’s true.” A peace came into his heart. As he walked toward home, the restrictions, the demands, the requirements over which he had been so incensed began to appear as opportunities. When he opened the door, he found his wife had been on her knees.\nThen, before the congregation to whom he told this, he spoke of the gladness that had come into their lives. Tithing was not a problem. The sharing of their substance with God who had given them everything seemed little enough. Time for service was not a problem. This required only a little careful budgeting of the hours of the week. Responsibility was not a problem. Out of it came growth and a new outlook on life. And then this man of intellect and training, this engineer accustomed to dealing with the facts of the physical world in which we live, bore solemn testimony with moistened eyes of the miracle that had come into his life.\nSo it is with hundreds of thousands in many lands—men and women of capacity and training, of business and the professions, hardheaded, practical men who do things in the work of the world, in whose hearts there burns a silent witness that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that this work is divine, that it was restored to earth for the blessing of all who will partake of its opportunities.\nSaid the Lord: “Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.” (Rev. 3:20.)\nJesus, speaking to the Jews in the temple, said: “My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.\n“If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.” (John 7:16–17.)\nThis is the wonder of this work, that every man may know for himself. He is not dependent on the teacher or the preacher or the missionary, except as they might instruct and bear witness. As Job declared long ago: “… there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.” (Job 32:8.)\nEach man may know for himself that it is true through the gift of the Holy Spirit, and with as certain an assurance as that the sun will rise in the morning. And knowing that it is true, he will be inclined to discipline himself as becomes one who has a knowledge of the meaning and purpose of life, of his great responsibility to his fellowmen, of his responsibility to his family, of his responsibility to God.\n“Learn of me,” said the Lord, “and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me.” (D&C 19:23.)\nThis is “the peace that passeth all understanding,” because it comes not of the mind, but of the Spirit, and “the things of God are understood by the Spirit of God.”\nA brilliant and highly educated young woman spoke in Berchtesgaden, Germany, to a conference of American military personnel who were members of the Church. I was there and heard her. She was a major in the army, a medical doctor, a highly respected specialist in her field. She said:\n“More than anything else in the world, I wanted to serve God. But try as I might, I could not find him. The miracle of it all is that he found me. One Saturday afternoon in September 1969 I was at home in Berkeley, California, and heard my doorbell ring. There were two young men there, dressed in suits, with white shirts and ties. Their hair was neatly combed. I was so impressed with them that I said: ‘I don’t know what you’re selling, but I’ll buy it.’ One of the young men said: ‘We aren’t selling anything. We’re missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and we would like to talk with you.’ I invited them to come in, and they spoke about their faith.\n“This was the beginning of my testimony. I am thankful beyond words for the privilege and honor of being a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The joy and peace this glad gospel has brought to my heart is heaven on earth. My testimony of this work is the most precious thing in my life, a gift from my Heavenly Father, for which I will be eternally thankful.”\nThis knowledge comes now just as it came anciently. It so came to my friend, the naval officer from Asia. It so came to the engineer in the East whose words I quoted. It so came to this medical doctor whose testimony I have repeated. In this hall there are thousands who could speak similarly. Across the world there are now millions. And if there be any within the sound of my voice who are searching for the witness of the Holy Spirit in these matters, I give you my testimony that it may be had. It will come now just as it came to Peter of old:\n“When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, … whom say ye that I am?\n“And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\n“And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.\n“And I also say unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” (Matt. 16:13–18.)\nThis rock of revelation is the source of knowledge concerning the things of God. It is the witness of the Holy Spirit that testifies of eternal truth, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against any man who seeks it, who accepts it, who cultivates it, and who lives by it.\nOf these sacred things I offer my solemn testimony and invoke the blessings of this knowledge upon all earnest seekers after truth, in the name of the author of truth, even the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "Who has not been touched by the singing of these innocent children? I think of the account in Third Nephi, chapter 17, when the Lord commanded that the little ones should be brought. As they brought them they placed them upon the ground. He commanded that the multitude should give way until all the little ones were there. Then he commanded that the multitude should kneel. He knelt among the little children and prayed.\nThe account records:\n“… The eye hath never seen, neither hath the ear heard, before, so great and marvelous things as we saw and heard Jesus speak unto the Father;\n“And no tongue can speak, neither can there be written by any man, neither can the hearts of men conceive so great and marvelous things as we both saw and heard Jesus speak. …”\nAfter the prayer, it is recorded that he wept. And then, “he took their little children, one by one, and blessed them, and prayed unto the Father for them.\n“And when he had done this he wept again;\n“And he spake unto the multitude, and said unto them: Behold your little ones.” (3 Ne. 17:16–17, 21–23.)\nI confess, I am not ashamed to confess, that little children get inside of me very easily. We have a little fellow at home not quite four. All he has to say to turn lights on in me is one word, “Dad.” I am indebted to him for some of the help with this assignment today.\n“… children are an heritage of the Lord” (Ps. 127:3), and I desire today to talk to little children. Many of them are here in the choir. Others, a great number of them, are listening in. I think the grown-ups won’t mind if I don’t talk to them.\nThere is something very important that I want to say to you children. Something I hope you’ll always remember. Something you should learn when you are children and things are easy to remember.\nDid you know that you lived before you were born on earth? Before you were born to your father and mother you lived in the spirit world.\nThat is a very important thing to know. It explains many things that otherwise are very difficult to understand. Many people in the world do not know that, but it is the truth.\nWhen you were born into this life you were not created then. Only your physical body was created. You came from somewhere. You left the presence of your Heavenly Father, for it was your time to live upon the earth.\nThere were two reasons you were to come into this life. First, to receive a mortal body. This is a great blessing. Our Heavenly Father arranged things so that through a very sacred expression of love between your father and mother your body was conceived and began to grow. Then at some time, I don’t know just when, your spirit entered into your body and you became a living person. But it did not all begin with your birth as a little baby.\nYour body becomes an instrument of your mind and the foundation of your character. Through life in a mortal body you can learn to control matter, and that will be very important to you through all eternity.\nPretend, my little friends, that my hand represents your spirit. It is alive. It can move by itself. Suppose that this glove represents your mortal body. It cannot move. When the spirit enters into your mortal body, then it can move and act and live. Now you are a person—a spirit with a body, living on the earth.\nIt was not intended that we stay here forever. Just for a lifetime. Little ones, you are just beginning your lifetime. Your grandparents and great-grandparents are nearly finished with theirs. It wasn’t long ago that they were little fellows and little girls just like you are now. But one day they will leave this mortal existence, and so will you.\nSomeday, because of old age, or perhaps a disease, or an accident, the spirit and the body will be separated. We then say a person has died. Death is a separation. All of this was according to a plan.\nRemember my hand represents your spirit and the glove represents your body. While you are alive the spirit inside the body can cause it to work and to act and to live.\nWhen I separate them, the glove, which represents your body, is taken away from your spirit; it cannot move anymore. It just falls down and is dead. But your spirit is still alive.\n“A spirit born of God is an immortal thing. When the body dies, the spirit does not die.” (First Presidency, March 1912, p. 463.)\nIt is important that you get in your mind what death is. Death is a separation.\nThe part of you that looks out through your eyes and allows you to think and smile and act and to know and to be, that is your spirit and that is eternal. It cannot die.\nDo you remember when someone, perhaps a grandmother, died? Remember your parents explained to you that it was just her body lying in the casket, that grandmother had gone to live with Heavenly Father, and that she would be waiting there. You remember having them say that, don’t you?\nDeath is a separation and is according to the plan. If the plan ended there, it would be too bad, because we came to obtain a body and it would be lost.\nWhen he made it possible for us to come into this world, our Heavenly Father also made it possible for us to return to him, because he is our Father and he loves us. Do not think that because we are living on this earth, away from him, and because we can’t see him, he has forgotten us.\nDidn’t you notice, when your older brother was away on his mission, or your sister was away at school, how your parents did not stop loving them? Sometimes it seemed to you they loved them more than they did you. At least they would talk about them and sometimes worry about them. They sent help and messages to encourage them. Distance can make love grow stronger.\nLittle children, our Heavenly Father knew that we would need help. So, in the plan, he provided for someone to come into the world and help us.\nThis was Jesus Christ, the Son of God. He is a spirit child as all of us are; but also, Jesus was his Only Begotten Son on the earth. I speak very reverently of him. And he it was, my little friends, who made it possible for us to overcome death and get things put back the way they should be.\nYou are learning about him in Sunday School, in Primary, and in family home evening. It is very important that you remember him and learn all you can about what he did.\nHe overcame the mortal death for us. Through the atonement, he made it possible for our spirit and body to be one again. Because of him we will be resurrected. He made it possible for us to be resurrected, for the spirit and the body to be put back together. That is what the resurrection is. That is a gift from him. And all men will receive it. That is why he is called our Savior, our Redeemer.\nThe second reason you came here was to be tested: something like going away to school to learn good from evil. It is very important for us to be able to know the right from the wrong.\nIt is important for us to know that there is an evil one who will tempt you to do wrong. Because of this, there is another separation you should know about. Even when you are very young you should know about it. There is another separation that you need to think about—not the separation of the body from the spirit; rather, a separation from our Heavenly Father.\nIf we remain separated from him and can’t get back to his presence, then it would be as though we were spiritually dead. And that would not be good. This separation is like a second death, a spiritual death.\nYou are now learning to read, and you can begin to read the scriptures: the Bible, especially the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. From them we know that little children can learn spiritual truths. For the prophet said:\n“… he imparteth his word by angels unto men, yea, not only men but women also. Now this is not all; little children do have words given unto them many times which confound the wise and the learned.” (Alma 32:23.)\nIn the scriptures we learn that our spirits must be clean, in order to return to the presence of our Heavenly Father:\n“… there cannot any unclean thing enter into the kingdom of God. …” (1 Ne. 15:34.)\nTwo important things must happen to us then. First, somehow we must get our body back after we die—that is, we want to be resurrected; and we must find a way to keep ourselves clean, spiritually clean, so that we will not be separated from our Heavenly Father and may return to where he is when we leave this earth life.\nWe are sure you will overcome mortal death. You will be resurrected because of what Christ did for us. Whether or not you overcome the spiritual death—that separation from the presence of our Heavenly Father—will depend a great deal upon you.\nWhen Jesus Christ was living on the earth, he taught his gospel and organized his church. If we live the gospel, we will remain spiritually clean. Even when we make mistakes, there is a way to become clean again. That is what repentance is.\nTo enter his church we must have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. We must repent, and we must be baptized.\nBaptism is like being buried in the water. When we come out of the water, it is like being born again, and we are clean. We receive a remission of our sins. That means they are taken away. We can retain this remission of our sins if we will.\nWe are then confirmed members of his church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We may have the gift of the Holy Ghost to guide us. That is like receiving messages from our heavenly home, to show us the way to go.\nThe Lord called prophets and apostles to lead his church. He has always revealed his will through his prophets.\nLet me tell you something I learned when I was about your age. I think I was about six or seven years old. My brother and I (we were about the same age) walked to the stake conference together. I can still go in that building in Brigham City and go back just under the balcony, and say, “I was sitting about there when it happened.”\nWhat was it that happened? There was a man speaking at the pulpit, Elder George Albert Smith. He was a member of the Council of the Twelve at that time. I do not remember what he said, whether he was talking about the Word of Wisdom, or about repentance, or about baptism. But somehow while he was speaking it was fixed in my little-boy mind that there stood a servant of the Lord. I have never lost that testimony or that feeling. In my mind I came to know that he was an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ.\nMy little friends, although I sit now in the Council of the Twelve, I have never lost that feeling about these men. Often when we meet in the Council, I look around the circle and know again that these are the apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ upon the earth. They are special witnesses of him.\nLittle ones, you will be tested, perhaps more than any generation that ever lived here. You will meet many people who do not believe in Christ. Some will be agents for the evil one and teach wickedness. Sometimes this will be very tempting. There will be times when you will make mistakes (and all of us make mistakes). There will be times when you will wonder if you can live the way he taught we should live. When you are tested, when you are disappointed, or ashamed, or when you are sad, remember him and pray to your Heavenly Father in his name.\nSome men will say that he did not come to earth. But he did. Some will say that he is not the Son of God. But he is. Some will say that he has no servants upon the face of the earth. But he has. For he lives. I know that he lives. In his church there are many thousands who can bear witness of him, and I bear witness of him, and tell you again the things you should remember, things you should learn when you are yet a little one.\nRemember that each of you is a child of our Heavenly Father. That is why we call him our Father.\nYou lived before you came to this earth. You came to receive a mortal body and to be tested.\nWhen your life is over, your spirit and body will be separated. We call that death.\nOur Heavenly Father sent his Son, Jesus Christ, to redeem us. Because of what he has done we will be resurrected.\nThere is another kind of death you should think of. That is the separation from the presence of our Heavenly Father. If we will be baptized and live his gospel, we may be redeemed from this second death.\nOur Heavenly Father loves us, and we have a Lord and Savior.\nI thank God for a church where you, our little children, are precious above all things. I thank God for our Savior who suffered the little children to come unto him.\nYou sang these words, just a few minutes ago:\n\n“I think when I read that sweet story of old,\nWhen Jesus was here among men,\nHow he called little children like lambs to his fold,\nI should like to have been with him then.\n\n“I wish that his hands had been placed on my head,\nThat his arms had been thrown around me,\nThat I might have seen his kind look when he said,\n‘Let the little ones come unto me.’”\n\n— no. B-69\n\nMy little brothers and sisters, my little children, I know that God lives. I know something of how it feels to have his hand put upon you, to call you to his service. I bear witness and share with you the witness that has been given me, that special witness. He is the Christ! He loves us! I pray for you, our little ones, and plead with him to behold our little ones and to bless them, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "In the brief period that I occupy this pulpit, I pray that my remarks may be in harmony with the spirit of this conference. I acknowledge the divinity of the direction the Church is receiving from President Harold B. Lee, our prophet, and the strength and wisdom of President Tanner and President Romney and all of the other General Authorities as they assist in guiding and encouraging the Church membership throughout the world to live lives that are compatible with the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nWe have all been greatly touched by these beautiful voices of the Primary children, and I hope to direct my remarks to those who have a great responsibility regarding these precious lives.\nAs I view the struggles of mankind in this challenging time, I reflect on the familiar phrase of Henry Van Dyke, which most high school students were required at one time to memorize. Van Dyke wrote:\n\n“Four things a man must learn to do,\nIf he would make a record true,\nTo think without confusion clearly,\nTo love his fellowmen sincerely,\nTo act from honest motives purely,\nTo trust in God and heaven securely.”\n\n“To trust in God and heaven securely.” Wouldn’t there be a feeling of great security if you knew that your home produced sons and daughters who trust in God securely—really trust in him, believing in him and in his Son, Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world?\nIn these times, it can be difficult to think clearly, to hold to a high degree of integrity and loyalty, and to maintain lofty ideals in a generation that seems to have lost its scale of values. The current wave of permissiveness in many areas of our lives is being encouraged by false interpretations of our true, basic, moral principles.\nThe Savior warned us of these times:\n“… there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.” (Matt. 24:24.)\nUnfortunately, along with much of the world, some of our loved ones are influenced by false prophets, false Christs, and modern movements of spiritualism. Some have become victims of satanic influences because they do not understand or realize the power of the adversary who knows human weaknesses and is ever present.\nWho is this evil power? Is he real? Does he exist?\nJohn the Revelator capsuled that powerful struggle in heaven, the outcome of which has such an impact on all of humanity:\n“And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,\n“And prevailed not; …\n“And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, … which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.\n“And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, … for the accuser of our brethren is cast down. …\n“… Woe to the inhabiters of the earth … ! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” (Rev. 12:7–10, 12.)\nThere is an eternal struggle with evil forces. John the Revelator has warned us, “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth … !” He is speaking to all of us. He says, Be on guard; beware.\nThe Lord God also warns us in modern revelation:\n“Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I should give unto him mine own power; by the power of mine Only Begotten, I caused that he should be cast down;\n“And he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto my voice.” (Moses 4:3–4.)\nDoes God’s warning of this evil power come through to us clearly? “… to deceive … to blind men … lead them captive … as many as would not hearken unto my voice.” This evil is influencing the rapid deterioration of our sacred, moral principles that seems to be sweeping the land. Some neighborhood movie houses now show films that neither parents nor society would have tolerated a few years ago. Hard-core pornography is now available at candy stores and supermarkets at popular prices.\nIn the brief period of the past ten years, this country and most of the free world have been converted into a space-age Sodom and Gomorrah, aided by some publishers, movie producers, and even some so-called educators. Moral principles have been eclipsed by the blind, ungodly pursuit of pleasure—pleasure at any price.\nAlma in the Book of Mormon records Korihor’s sad experience with Satan:\n“… behold, the devil hath deceived me; for he appeared unto me in the form of an angel, and said unto me: … There is no God; yea, and he taught me that which I should say. And I have taught his words; … and I taught them, even until I had much success, … that I verily believed that they were true; and for this cause I withstood the truth; even until I have brought this great curse upon me.” (Alma 30:53.)\nMany people who believe at least tentatively in the reality of God have a much harder time believing in the reality of the devil. Some even soft-pedal the subject and go along with the popular idea that the devil is a purely mythological creature.\nSome people roar with laughter as a television comic remarks, “The devil made me do it.” Well, maybe he did! He will always try.\nTo deny the existence of Satan and the reality of his evil power and influence is as foolish as ignoring the existence of electricity. We know electricity is real; we see and feel its power. We also know about war, hatred, backbiting, false witnesses, cheating, and the broken hearts and broken homes caused by the moral sins of modern Babylon. Do members of this church feel a lack of evidence in the reality of Satan and his power?\nWe are told that some of the “very elect” will be enticed and deceived. Couldn’t this “very elect” include your sons and daughters, even though through baptism they have already accepted Christ as their Savior? Wouldn’t the evil one concentrate on them if he found a weakness or an opportunity?\nA college student hoping to repent of some serious mistakes and straighten out his life told me only a few days ago of an influence which, for a time, controlled his life. His desire to have some expert ski equipment encouraged him to accept a job on Sundays and evenings. This prevented him from attending priesthood and other Sunday meetings. Now he was too tired to attend early morning seminary. With his new, fancy ski equipment, he made the high school team and made some new friends. To be “with it,” he started to smoke and soon moved to marijuana and from marijuana to LSD. His father and mother now appeared old-fashioned to him. He moved from his parents’ home to live with his newfound friends in an old house. The house had extra rooms, so they invited a young lady—also on drugs—to move in. His father tried to visit him, to communicate through letters. But this young man now felt completely disenchanted with church and home. After these tragic mistakes, he finally came to his senses and moved home with his parents. He told me, “The devil seemed to be in charge of my life.”\nAfter interviewing the youth in his ward, a dedicated bishop recently commented on the lack of spiritual direction given by some parents to their own teenage sons and daughters. He said, “Bishops and teachers can’t do it all. Parents must teach their children of the pitfalls of evil.” This bishop then compared differences in priorities in the homes as reflected in his interviews with the youth. One girl said, “I know the gospel is true; I live it; I keep the commandments; no problems.” Another young lady remarked, “I don’t accept all of it; I’m battling with some parts; we never discuss it at home.”\n“… never discuss it at home.” What a tragedy! Strengthen your home. Teach your loved ones to distinguish between Satan and our Savior. Teach your loved ones that “all things which are good cometh of God; and that which is evil cometh of the devil; for the devil is an enemy unto God, … and inviteth and enticeth to sin.” (Moro. 7:12.)\nNot explaining these eternal truths of the gospel in the warm atmosphere of your home could be the difference between exaltation and darkness. At a crucial moment in a youth’s life, the humble testimony of mother and father could be recalled and make the difference in a critical decision.\nTrue happiness in this life and the life to come is found in keeping the commandments of God. “… you shall live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God.” (D&C 84:44.)\nI bear witness this day that the devil is real. I have felt of his influence. The apostle Paul knew firsthand of his power. As Saul of Tarsus he persecuted the saints; locked them in prison; gave voice against them when they were put to death. Saul, now the believer and great apostle, encouraged the followers of Christ at Ephesus:\n“Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.\n“For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world. …” (Eph. 6:11–12.)\nIf you and your loved ones keep and live the commandments of God, following the counsel of his living prophet to strengthen your homes, this protecting armor of God that Paul referred to will fit comfortably; the shield of righteousness will be sufficient to withstand the evil darts; and your loved ones will find great joy and salvation, for they will have learned and will know how—\n\n“To think without confusion clearly,\nTo love his fellowmen sincerely,\nTo act from honest motives purely,\nTo trust in God and heaven securely.”\n\nMay this be your lot with you and your families, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, our Savior. Amen."

        "month": "04",
        "year": 1973,
        "content": "Following the theme that was so masterfully developed this morning by President Tanner, I would like to present a few thoughts on success.\nSuccess is that illusive and almost indefinable goal to which all men are looking, but success is hardly ever the same thing to two different people.\nThe dictionary defines success as “the favorable termination of a venture,” which implies it is a risky, daring, or dangerous undertaking. A second definition is, “the attainment of wealth, favor, or eminence,” and surely this is the most commonly used definition today.\nWe are prone to apply the term successful to those who look prosperous or wealthy or appear to have scaled the pinnacle of accomplishment in their own particular profession. Whether a man be a doctor, lawyer, financier, builder, politician, an admiral or a general, an actor, an airline pilot, or an athlete, all these and many others have the term success applied to them. But is this really success?\nMan’s definition of success is, many times, very difficult to comprehend. Some feel to be right is to be successful. Henry Clay said he would rather be right than president. Perhaps he felt successful: he ran for the presidency three times and failed all three times. “Even a stopped clock is right twice a day. After some years it can boast a long series of successes.” (Abner-Eschenbach.)\n“The reasonable man will know that the actual magnitude of success obtained bears no real relation to the amount of pleasure that is conveyed; the man who becomes prime minister or wins a Nobel prize is not really more elated than he who secures a trophy for playing Ping Pong or wins a bronze medal for growing large chrysanthemums.” (Harold Necholson.)\nThe Lord doesn’t seem to measure success in terms of attainment of position or power or wealth. A prophet in the Book of Mormon (where, by the way, the most succinct and unvarnished truths can be found) said, “But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things. Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.” (2 Ne. 2:24–25.) If man is that he might have joy, then success to the Lord must include the attainment of real joy. On the basis of this definition, then, no one is really successful who is not happy.\nIf this be the Lord’s definition, then there is precious little success in this world. Success in its practical application seems to be more a state of mind than anything else. Obviously, many people never make it because they are ungrateful. They are not thankful for what they have; therefore, they are unhappy and thus are not successful. I have never seen a happy person who was not thankful for what he had, to paraphrase the Prophet Joseph Smith, who stated that “doubt and faith cannot exist in the same person at the same time.” (6th Lecture on Faith.) It is also doubtful that success and unhappiness can exist in the same person at the same time.\nGenerally speaking, we are unhappy because we are dissatisfied, and this because we pursue after things that cannot make us happy, even if we obtain them. In the words of H. W. Beecher, “Success is full of promise till men get it, and then is as a last year’s nest, from which the bird has flown.”\nThere is a great lesson to be learned here. Some think of success as obtaining “something for nothing” or the securing of a great bargain. The words of James Russell Lowell seem particularly applicable. He said, “Earth gets its price from what Earth gives us.” In order to be happy, it is particularly important that we learn that everything has its price and not expect something for nothing. This seems to be what earth life is all about—to teach us the lesson that as ye sow, so shall ye reap. We cannot receive something for nothing: on the contrary, we will pay for everything we receive. To continue with Lowell’s quote:\n\n“Earth gets its price from what Earth gives us;\nThe beggar is taxed for a corner to die in, …\nWe bargain for the graves we lie in;\nAt the devil’s booth are all things sold,\nEach ounce of dross costs its ounce of gold;\nFor a cap and bells our lives we pay,\nBubbles we buy with a whole soul’s tasking.\nFor ’tis heaven alone that is given away,\n’Tis only God may be had for the asking. …”\n\n(“The Vision of Sir Launfal,” Stanza 3.)\n\nHow true this is! We pursue after bubbles many times, thinking they will make us happy and that obtaining this particular bubble would make us successful. There are many, many bubbles for sale. This is another word for material possessions, which the world would have us believe are necessary to make us happy. We get the idea from modern advertising that happiness comes from the accumulation of material possessions. We must have a new house, a new car, or a snowmobile, or maybe even a boat.\nElder ElRay L. Christiansen tells an interesting story about his neighbor who bought a boat. He really couldn’t afford a boat; but he bought it anyway, because he had a credit card. In order to pay for the boat, he had to take a second job, which meant he had to work on Saturday. This, of course, left one day per week on which he could use the boat. When do you suppose that was? Yes, you are right—it was Sunday. But he loved his boat and invited Brother Christiansen over to admire it, saying, “Isn’t it beautiful? What shall we name it?” (Now, you see, it is a member of the family—it has to have a name.)\nBrother Christiansen said, “Why don’t you call it The Sabbath Breaker?” ( April 1962, p. 33.) Now, please don’t misunderstand me—I have nothing against boats. I have a friend who has a boat, and he calls his boat “Never on Sunday,” which, of course, is a better name for a boat.\nThere is no real joy or happiness in the accumulation of material possessions. There are too many people today who are so miserable in this life that they cannot stand themselves. They are seeking any avenue of escape—to get out of this life, even to taking their own lives. Many of these people have material possessions heaped up in piles all around them—and many of their associates would say they were successful. But material possessions have not made them happy.\nThe Master emphasized this when he said, “For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?” (Matt. 16:26.) And then he added significantly, “But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.” (Matt. 6:33.)\nA young man came to see me recently who had been called by the Lord to fill a mission. He was a fine young man—handsome, strong, sharp—but he said he didn’t want to go on his mission because there were other things that he would rather do. As we visited he told me that one thing he would rather do was drive a dune buggy. We talked about the relative merits of trading eternal life for a dune buggy; and he decided, perhaps, that was not exactly a fair exchange. I suggested to him that if he still wanted to drive a dune buggy after he had filled his mission, the Lord would probably let him do so, since the Lord always grants unto men “according to their desire.” (Alma 29:4.)\nWe must not be misled. The only real joy and happiness we can know here upon this earth, as well as in the eternities, will come through obedience to the Lord’s commandments. Alma’s statement that “wickedness never was happiness” (Alma 41:10) is still valid. Again he has said, “If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.” (John 13:17.) He did not say, but could have said, “Unhappy are ye if you don’t.”\nSometimes young people get upset because they do not know what profession to follow. They feel it is so vital that they must have a revelation from the Lord, so they will know what to do with their lives. Generally speaking, I’m not sure that the Lord really cares what we choose as a vocation—whether we are a plumber or a librarian—so long as we keep the commandments of God. Of course, it is sometimes easier to keep the commandments when we are happy in our professions, and to that extent it is important that we do something we enjoy.\nThe Lord, through living prophets as well as prophets in earlier times, has made it abundantly clear where real joy can be found, and he has placed the emphasis for real joy squarely on the family. President David O. McKay’s statement that “no other success can compensate for failure in the home” will forever live in our hearts.\nPresident Harold B. Lee uttered an equally significant statement when he said, “Now, you husbands, remember that the most important of the Lord’s work that you will ever do will be the work you do within the walls of your own home.” (First Presidency Directive, April 14, 1969.) These statements and others update and reemphasize the Lord’s injunction to Adam and Eve in the Garden when he commanded them to “be fruitful, and multiply and replenish the earth.” (Gen. 1:28.) Why should they do this? “That ye may have joy and rejoicing in your posterity.”\nThe Lord gives no commandments to his children that are not calculated to make them happy and thus successful. Therefore, he has added to the basic commandment of “be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth,” the reason for so doing: that you may have joy and rejoicing in your posterity.\nLehi’s statement that “man is that he might have joy” takes on even more significance in light of this and the foregoing statement made by living prophets. And the Prophet Joseph Smith also added to this statement when he said, “Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it. …” ( p. 255.)\nFrom what we have considered, that path inevitably leads to the altar of the temple. I have, many times, seen the Spirit lift choice young people who had come to the temple to become a family; and it seemed to me in these instances that the temple became a “heavenly family house,” the sealing room became a “heavenly family room,” and the altar of the temple became a “heavenly family altar.” For as they knelt there, they were joined by the Lord through his priesthood for all eternity and thus were made “one,” a family, in the Lord. The importance of this ordinance cannot be overemphasized, for if we raise a family outside the temple, we may lose it. We have no promise with respect to the continuation of family ties after we leave this life unless the covenants have been solemnized at the altar of the temple. Otherwise, it is only “until death do ye part.”\nGod is the Heavenly Father of the human family. He is obviously concerned with families. If you doubt it, look around you. We are all his children—we belong to him. For this reason, he has commanded that a house be built for his family.\nOur heavenly and eternal Father wants us to be happy, so he has established and ordained families as the basic unit of his church. Yes—and also of exaltation in his celestial kingdom. Happiness seems vital to success, or is it that success is vital to happiness? Either way. I do not believe I have ever seen happy parents who had unhappy children; and, conversely, I have never seen unhappy children who had happy parents.\nSo, then, what is required of parents, who have been so joined in the Lord’s house, concerning their children? First, they are to love each other—this is so vital; then they are to welcome choice spirits from the Lord and teach them to love the Lord, keep his commandments, and walk uprightly before him. When they do this, they have given these children the foundation for attaining real joy here in this world and in the world to come. For they will have eternal life, which is the ultimate success, and they will be made rich. “… Behold, he that has eternal life is rich.” (D&C 6:7.)\nMay this be our goal, and may we be willing to pay the price to obtain it and not be taken in by all the misinformation which is abroad in the land today about birth control, abortion and sex education, and other Satan-inspired philosophies; that we may look to the Lord and follow his living prophets and oracles today. I pray that we will, for I bear witness that God our Heavenly Father lives, and that he hears and answers prayers, and that he is concerned about his children, so much so that he sent his Only Begotten Son that we might have immortality and eternal life.\nMay we follow him, and may we keep his commandments, and may we be successful, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "I am sure that as grandfathers and fathers, you rejoice with me in these children who have rendered the singing at this session of the conference. They are wonderful. Being a grandfather of 14, I have learned to love grandchildren.\nI am reminded of the grandfather who got on the airplane. As he went down the aisle looking for a seat, he came to an attractive woman, and he said, “Are you a grandmother?” And she said, “Yes, I am.” So he passed her up. He went on and repeated it again. Finally he asked a lady, “Are you a grandmother?” And she said, “No, I am not.” He said, “May I sit down? I want to talk about my grandchildren.”\nIn the few moments allotted to me, I would like to discuss the subject of faith, what it means, and how it affects us as individuals.\nWhen I made preparation for this talk, I had no idea that in our family we would be called on so soon to exercise great faith and prayers for the well-being of my sweet companion, who underwent major surgery just last Monday. Our faith and prayers were answered, and I want to thank all of my brethren here and all of my friends and others who joined with us in their faith and prayers for her recovery. She is listening from her hospital bed. I would like to take just a moment to tell her how much I love her. She has been a wonderful companion for 49 years this month. She has been an inspiration to me all the days that we have been married. She has been a fine mother and grandmother. We are looking forward to her return from the hospital.\nThe apostle Paul tells us: “… faith is the substance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen.” (Heb. 11:1.) Faith and belief have been used synonymously, and it is sometimes difficult for us to differentiate between the two. There is a difference.\nWe cannot have faith without belief, but we can believe without having faith. Belief is the foundation of faith. Faith is trusting in our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\nThe scriptures contain many assurances of salvation to those who exercise faith and obey the commandments. One such assurance is found in Mark 16:16, which reads: “He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.” Note that the Lord said: “He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved.” In other words, we must do more than believe—we must act. Faith is the motivating force that impels action.\nIn James 2:20 we read: “But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?”\nMany believe that God will provide, but we cannot sit idly by and expect to get results. The Lord requires us to work for that which we seek. If we do our part and exercise faith, then we are promised he will help us in all our righteous undertakings. However, if we do not do our part, how can we expect the help of our Heavenly Father? Our late President David O. McKay said, “The rich rewards come only to the strenuous strugglers.” In other words, to those who not only have faith but are willing to work and sacrifice in order to achieve their goals.\nSome may ask, “How do we gain faith?” The answer is that we gain faith just as we gain any other attribute. We must first establish a foundation, and then cultivate our thoughts and actions.\nJoseph Smith said: “Faith comes by hearing the word of God, through the testimony of the servants of God. …” ( vol. 3, p. 379.) Our very presence in meetings of this conference will tend to increase our faith because we come here with a desire to learn and to worship, to be motivated, and to be spiritually uplifted.\nI testify to all within the sound of my voice that my attendance at general conferences over a period of many years, hearing the testimonies of our leaders here and in other places, has constantly increased my faith and helped me to build a strong testimony as to the truthfulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nPartaking of the sacrament administered by those having authority is a great aid to faith. The broken bread symbolizes the broken flesh of our Redeemer, and the holy cup represents his atoning blood. Reading the scriptures nurtures faith. Earnest prayer is essential to increasing one’s faith. Prayer is vocalized faith.\nRight living is the greatest of all faith builders. Sin is the greatest of all faith destroyers. Even small sins destroy faith. Vanity, pride, selfishness, greed, and hatred wound the fine spirit of God which nurtures and gives life to faith.\nCeaseless striving to find the bright light of living faith purifies the heart, strengthens the will, and develops sterling character.\nThe constant exercise of our faith by lofty thinking, prayer, devotion, and acts of righteousness is just as essential to spiritual health as physical exercise is to the health of the body. Like all priceless things, faith, if lost, is hard to regain. Eternal vigilance is the price of our faith. In order to retain our faith we must keep ourselves in tune with our Heavenly Father by living in accordance with the principles and ordinances of the gospel.\nMoses exercised faith when he led the children of Israel out of bondage. The Lord instructed him what to do, and he had faith that it could be done. He gathered the Israelites and proceeded on the journey. You will remember that they were closely followed by the Egyptians, who wanted to prevent their leaving.\nThey reached the Red Sea, and the Israelites felt there was no chance of escape. The sea lay before them and the Egyptians behind. Some said: “… it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.”\nMoses told them: “Fear ye not. … the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace.”\nThe Lord, speaking to Moses, said:\n“… lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.\n“And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.\n“And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.\n“And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.” (Ex. 14:12–14, 16, 21–23.)\nAnd then the Lord told Moses to stretch out his hand, and the water would come back and destroy the Egyptians. Moses again exercised his faith in God, and the Egyptians were destroyed.\nThe Prophet Joseph demonstrated great faith throughout his ministry. When he was only 14, he was reading the scriptures, and in the first chapter of James, fifth and sixth verses, he read:\n“If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\n“But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.”\nThis passage of scripture rocked his very soul, for he felt that if ever a person needed wisdom in deciding what to do, it was he.\nHe believed; he had faith; his faith impelled action, and so he went into the woods to pray. His prayers were answered.\nHow different our lives would be if it had not been for the strong faith of the Prophet Joseph!\nBrigham Young was a man of great faith. He had faith in a living God. He had faith in every principle and doctrine revealed and taught by the Prophet Joseph. He had faith in himself.\nHe once made this statement:\n“If the Latter-day Saints will walk up to their privileges, and exercise faith in the name of Jesus Christ, and live in the enjoyment of the fulness of the Holy Ghost constantly day by day, there is nothing on the face of the earth that they could ask for, that would not be given to them.” ( vol. 11, p. 114.)\nThe Latter-day Saint pioneers certainly demonstrated great faith when they crossed the plains. They left their homes and most of their worldly belongings. Some of them left their families and friends to follow the Church leaders to an unknown land. The reason was obvious: they had great faith. They sought and found a place where they could exercise their faith, worship in peace, and serve the Lord.\nSometimes we become impatient because the world is converted so slowly. In our impatience, we wonder why God does not reveal himself in majesty and glory, that the whole world might instantly be brought to their knees to worship him. But when we think intelligently about the matter, we understand that God’s slow, patient way of converting the world is best. When people are required to believe largely upon the testimony of others, they are compelled to grip the threads of truth firmly and hold on until they can develop strong faith. God’s plan makes it necessary for us to nurture, cultivate, and enlarge our faith. In this long, patient process of developing our faith, we acquire fortitude and strength of character. These sterling qualities are of eternal worth.\nI have been thrilled with the faith manifested by many of our recently returned prisoners of war. Many have expressed their faith in God, their faith in their families, and their faith in this great country and its leaders.\nIt is indeed gratifying to hear these expressions of love, faith, and gratitude from these men who have suffered so much. This is in such contrast to those who have protested everything our leaders have done to bring about the release of our prisoners and to reunite them with their families. I am sure we all feel grateful that this has been accomplished, and join together in giving thanks to our Heavenly Father for these great blessings. Our prayers and love are extended to all of these men, that they might get reestablished in the stream of life; that they might have joy in their labors and continue to show love for their God, their families, their country, and their fellowmen.\nThere has never been a time in our lives, the history of the Church, or the history of our nation, when there existed a greater need for faith than today.\nWe need faith in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, faith in our church leaders, faith in America, faith in ourselves.\nI conclude by bearing my witness as to the truthfulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The greatest blessings we have received in our family have been when we have been most liberal with our time, our means, and our efforts in carrying out our responsibilities in the Church. These blessings are available to everyone if they will but have faith, accept the gospel of Jesus Christ, and then live in conformity with its teachings.\nIt is my humble prayer that each of us will increase our faith day by day; that we will keep the commandments; that we will love, honor, and sustain our prophet, President Harold B. Lee, and all who are closely associated with him in building the kingdom of God; that we will so live as to be true to the end and worthy to receive the greatest of all blessings, which is salvation, exaltation, and eternal life in the kingdom of our Heavenly Father.\nIn the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "My dear brothers and sisters: It is a great privilege to be here with you on this occasion. I bring you greetings from the greatest group of missionaries in the world. It is a marvelous thing to labor among them and to feel the strength of the Lord as he works through them and the Saints to bring the gospel of Jesus Christ to his children.\nThe blessing of sharing the gospel message is overwhelming. I am often filled with the feelings I think Paul may have had when he wrote to the saints at Ephesus, regarding his call to serve the Lord:\n“Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me …\n“Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;\n“According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus, our Lord:\n“In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.\n“For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (Eph. 3:7–8, 11–12, 14.)\nThis same feeling of humble gratitude seems to fill the hearts of every member and missionary who becomes involved in sharing the gospel. As we see the peace and assurance that come to those who receive the gospel, we become more conscious of the great obligation and opportunity we have to share the restored gospel of Jesus Christ with our friends and neighbors, our brothers and sisters.\nThe Lord has spoken clearly regarding this sacred responsibility and the condemnation which rests upon members of his church should we fail to keep this commandment. On September 23, 1832, having given commandment unto the Twelve concerning the preaching of the gospel, the Lord then stated:\n“And this revelation unto you, and commandment, is in force from this very hour upon all the world, and the gospel is unto all who have not received it.\n“But, verily I say unto all those to whom the kingdom has been given—from you it must be preached unto them. …” (D&C 84:75–76.)\nJoseph Smith has said that the greatest and most important duty we have is to teach others the gospel. He declared the same thing about doing the work for the dead. Each of these activities makes available to others the blessings of membership in the kingdom of God.\nFulfilling this sacred assignment to “warn our neighbors” brings unspeakable joys to both the receiver and the giver of the gift. Many families throughout the Church are experiencing the joys of doing this most important work. Not only are they “laying up in store that they perish not,” but they are helping our nonmember brothers and sisters to become eligible for these same blessings. They are finding that missionary work is not a task, but a glorious opportunity to assist the Lord in his greatest work—saving the souls of men.\nThere are many ways one may help others find the Lord. The Jones family, in Raleigh, North Carolina, assisted the Lord by preparing a copy of the Book of Mormon with their family picture and testimony inside the front cover. They then invited the missionaries to their home to meet some close friends, the Browns. The next day the missionaries went to the Browns and presented to them this copy of the Book of Mormon as a gift from the Jones family. The Browns were so appreciative of the gift that they agreed to read, ponder, and pray about this marvelous book of scripture. They did. The elders continued to teach them. The Jones family continued to fellowship them. Today the entire Brown family enjoys church membership.\nMembers in a small Virginia branch recently asked for missionaries to labor with them in spreading the gospel in that area. They felt they could arrange at least five meetings per week for the missionaries with interested friends and neighbors. The members have found many more than they had supposed waiting to hear their message. For the past three months the elders have held from four to eight meetings per day. There have been so many meetings that one of the missionaries wrote on the bottom of his weekly report: “Dear President: I am sorry. We have been so busy teaching, we haven’t had time to tract; but don’t worry, we’ll do better next week!”\nThese missionaries had spent 65 hours that week teaching the message of the gospel of Jesus Christ to friends the members had found. This small branch has made tremendous growth in attendance and home teaching. Several persons who had been absent from church meetings for some time are now active. Through member participation, missionary work has become the solution to several of their problems.\nThere is a dentist who shares the gospel at every opportunity—to the “captive audience” in his chair, at the service station where he takes his car, at the post office, even at his neighbor’s home as he seeks advice in running his farm—just everywhere. He says he has read the Book of Mormon until he feels he understands the love and peace the sons of Mosiah felt when they went to preach to the Lamanites. And, I believe, he has the same zeal they had.\nThrough his efforts during the past year, missionaries have been introduced to hundreds of people and have brought four families into the Church. This fine member and his home teaching companion diligently go before the elders and set up meetings. He feels the people respond more readily to him because he is a permanent resident in the area. Again, member-missionary oneness has brought the light and peace of the gospel of Christ into the lives of those seeking the truth.\nAnother member, many miles away, shared the gospel in correspondence to a friend in Richmond, Virginia. A wonderful experience followed. Two missionaries were tracting one day in Richmond. One had been ill; the other felt uneasy as they walked the streets, knowing that his companion was not at his best. Both desired to persevere, however.\nAfter two hours of having little success, they knocked on a door and introduced themselves as missionaries with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. “Oh, yes,” the woman replied, “Ann Smith sent you.” The elders looked at each other, shook their heads, then told her they were just knocking at the doors in the neighborhood and that no person in particular had sent them to her. She invited them in; the husband and other family members were present in the room.\nShe then told the missionaries something that caused them to marvel. She said, “Just an hour or two ago I finished reading a letter that I had received today from my dearest friend who lives in California. A year ago her husband and she were converted to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and were recently married in the temple. When we last heard, their marriage was falling apart, and she confided in me the sad situation. But today I received this ten-page letter telling me all about your church and the marvelous change it has made in their lives.”\nShe allowed the missionaries to read the contents of that letter, which covered Relief Society, Primary, Sunday School, MIA, and much, much more. Then they read a short note at the bottom, which said, “I will be sending two missionaries to your house to teach you more about the Church.”\nAfter hearing the elders’ message, she said, with tears streaming down her face, “I believe the Lord sent you to us.”\nWhen members and missionaries work faithfully together, they become as one and the Lord can use them to achieve his purposes among his children. The Lord had united as one the efforts of this faithful member and these diligent missionaries, to bring this family instruction which, if followed, will bring them joy and peace beyond measure and lead them back into the presence of our Heavenly Father.\nToday we live in a time of trouble and turmoil. Many people are disturbed, discouraged, confused, and looking for something better. The Lord has provided that “something better” in the gospel of Jesus Christ. He has shown his love and concern for us in our time by appearing to a prophet, by revealing the Book of Mormon, and by restoring his church with his authority and power. We have the truth, the authority and power. Now it is our individual and family responsibility and our joy to share these blessings with others.\nPresident Joseph Fielding Smith, in addressing the British area conference of the Church, said:\n“There is only one plan of salvation. There is only one way for men to gain a celestial inheritance of eternal glory, and that is to forsake the world, have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, enter his kingdom through the door of baptism, receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and then keep his commandments.\n“We respect our Father’s other children of all sects, parties, and denominations, and have no desire except to see them receive the added light and knowledge that has come to us by revelation, and to become with us inheritors of the great blessings of the restoration of the gospel.\n“But we have the plan of salvation; we administer the gospel; and the gospel is the sole hope of the world, the one way that will bring peace on earth and right the wrongs that exist in all nations.” (“To the Saints in Great Britain,” September 1971, pp. 3–4.)\nBrothers and sisters, we have the charge to share “the unsearchable riches” of Christ with all of Heavenly Father’s children. We are blessed to have the promise of Ephraim to bring the blessings of the gospel to them. May we keep the commandment to “preach the gospel unto them” who have not yet received the kingdom, by working as one in the Lord’s great missionary effort.\nEach of us can give a Book of Mormon to a friend or business associate, each can invite someone to his home to be introduced to our Heavenly Father, each can write a letter to someone else, sharing testimony of these revealed truths and extending an invitation to them to receive the Lord’s plan. Yes, as you build your desire to be a missionary for the Lord, he will open up the way.\nWe invite all men everywhere to join with us that we might receive the blessing described by Paul when he wrote that the Lord “would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;\n“That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,\n“May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;\n“And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.\n“Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,\n“Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. …” (Eph. 3:16–21.)\nI solemnly declare my witness to you that Jesus is the Christ, that this is his church, and that President Harold B. Lee is his anointed prophet and seer today, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "Having spent nearly ten years in the mission field, I can appreciate very much the spirit that Brother Pinegar brings to us from the mission field. To me, missionary work is the greatest thing in all the world. I have the privilege nearly every week of talking to the new groups of missionaries before they leave for their missions. My assignment has been to discuss the use and the value of the holy scriptures.\n“Just think,” I say, “what would we know about our Father in heaven and his great love for us in giving us his Only Begotten Son, and his great atoning sacrifice for us, and why he created this earth, and why we are here, where we are going, and how to get there—if we didn’t have the holy scriptures?” I thank the Lord for the information that has come to us through the restoration of the gospel to help us to understand the holy scriptures.\nNow, we don’t only live in the past, by what is in the scriptures that has already transpired, for Isaiah said the Lord hath declared “the end from the beginning.” (See Isa. 46:10.) It is all there in the holy scriptures when we know how to understand it. He said, “The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand forever.” (Isa. 40:8.)\nI think of the words of the Lord to the prophet Malachi when he said: “Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple. … But who may abide the day of his coming? … for he is like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ soap.” (Mal. 3:1–2.)\nObviously that had no reference to his first coming. He did not come suddenly to his temple. All men could abide the day of his coming. He did not come cleansing and purifying as a refiner’s fire and fullers’ soap, but we are told that when he shall come in the latter days, the wicked shall cry out, and “then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.” (Luke 23:30.)\nIf the Lord were to send a messenger to prepare the way for his coming, that messenger could be none other than a prophet. You remember Amos said, “Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.” (Amos 3:7.) When John the Baptist was sent to prepare the way for the Savior in the meridian of time, the Savior bore testimony that there was no greater prophet in Israel than John the Baptist. (See Luke 7:28.)\nNow, it being true that the Lord would send a messenger in these latter days to prepare for the second coming of the Savior, just as he did at his first coming, it is important that we learn what that messenger has to say to the world. I think it is a wonderful thing that the Lord has indicated the end from the beginning. I would just like to refer to a few of the prophecies that relate to the day in which we live.\nFor instance, when John was banished upon the Isle of Patmos, the angel of the Lord said, “Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.” (Rev. 4:1.) This was 30 years after the crucifixion of the Savior. He saw the power that would be given to Satan to make war with the saints (and the saints were the followers of Jesus) and to overcome them and to rule over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations (see Rev. 13:7), showing a complete apostasy from the original church.\nBut the Lord didn’t leave it at that. This same angel showed John another angel flying in the midst of heaven, “having the everlasting gospel [and that is the only gospel that can save men] to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people.” (Rev. 14:6.) That isn’t the gospel of men. That is the gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored.\nNow why do you suppose that that passage of scripture is in the Bible, if we are not to look for an angel coming with the everlasting gospel to be preached to them that dwell upon the earth, to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people? That doesn’t leave anybody out, and that is why the Lord had to send his messenger so that this work could be restored to the earth.\nNow John did not only see that the angel would bring the everlasting gospel, but he would call men back to the worship of the true and the living God “that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.” (Rev. 14:7.) And if you will just stop to think, at the time that Joseph Smith had that marvelous vision of the Father and the Son, he saw that they were two glorified personages, that they were not three in one, without body, parts, or passions. There wasn’t a church in the world at that time, so far as we know, that was worshiping the true and the living God; so when the angel was to come with the everlasting gospel, he was also to bring men back to the worship of the true and living God who made the heavens and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.\nIn fact, at that time the whole Christian world believed in a God without body, parts, or passions. That means he had no eyes; he couldn’t see. He had no ears; he couldn’t hear. He had no voice; he couldn’t speak. How could they believe in such a god as that?\nMoses knew that this condition would prevail, because when he went to lead the children of Israel into the promised land, he told them that they would not remain there long, but that they would be scattered among the nations, and that they would “serve gods, the work of men’s hands [that is, man’s doing], … which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.” (Deut. 4:28.)\nAnd then Moses said that in the latter days (and we live in the latter days), if Israel would seek after God, they would surely find him. (See Deut. 4:29.) The Prophet Joseph sought after him, and he found him.\nWhy do you think that should be in the Bible if it should not happen? And when we announce that it has happened in our day, you would think that men would want to know more about it. When the apostles asked Jesus for the sign of his second coming and the end of the world, he told them of the wars and pestilence and earthquakes and famine, and we read a lot about them. Then he said, “And this gospel of the kingdom [the gospel that he taught] shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” (Matt. 24:14.)\nIf we expect to see him come again, we have to look for the preaching of that very same gospel, and that is the message of every Mormon elder who goes out into the world to bear testimony of the truth. I tell the missionaries, “If you can bring to people an understanding and a faith to believe in this message, it will be worth more than if you were to give them a million dollars.”\nI heard a missionary reporting his mission up in Oregon some years ago. He himself was a convert to the Church, and he came down with his fist on the pulpit and said he wouldn’t take a check for a million dollars for the experience of his mission, to go out and share with the world these marvelous truths.\nI sat back of him, and I asked myself: Would you take a check for a million dollars for your first mission over in the little land of Holland? I began counting the families whom I had been instrumental in bringing into the Church, who have come to Zion and sent their boys and girls on missions. What kind of a man would I be if I were to sell them out of the Church for a million dollars? I could not do that for all the money in this world. There is nothing else, no riches, that can compare with the joy and the happiness that come from this great missionary program of the Church.\nThen let us consider some other prophecies. For example, the Lord said through Isaiah:\n“Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:\n“Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.” (Isa. 29:13–14.)\nThere are so many marvelous things that have happened in the restoration of the gospel. Take the Book of Mormon, for example. Why, that is a miracle that no man can account for, if he will read it and study it. The greatest criticism of that book has come from those who have never read it. Yet it is full of marvelous truths that no man could have written with the knowledge that was available at the time that book was published.\nThe Book of Mormon tells us that when Lehi was in the desert, he told his son Joseph that the Lord had promised Joseph who was sold into Egypt that he would raise up a prophet in the latter days from his loins like unto Moses; that his name would be Joseph, his father’s name would be Joseph, and that he should bring forth his word. (See 2 Ne. 3:6, 9, 15.) That obviously was the Prophet Joseph Smith. He brought us the Book of Mormon. He brought us the Doctrine and Covenants. He brought us the Pearl of Great Price and many other writings.\nThen the Lord said: “… unto him will I give power to bring forth my word … and not to the bringing forth my word only, … but to the convincing them of my word, which shall have already gone forth among them.” (2 Ne. 3:11.) In other words, he would bring them to a true understanding of the Bible.\nThen he said, “[He] shall bring my people unto salvation.” (2 Ne. 3:15.) Why? Because he had the holy priesthood restored so that he could administer the saving ordinances of the gospel. And then the Lord adds, “And I will make him great in mine eyes.” (2 Ne. 3:8.) Whatever the world may think of the prophet of this dispensation, the Lord knew he would be great, for he had him in waiting for three thousand years when he promised Joseph that out of his loins he would raise up a prophet in our day.\nI would like to mention an experience to indicate what I think he meant when he said, “… unto him will I give power to bring forth my word … and not to the bringing forth my word only, … but to the convincing them of my word, which shall have already gone forth among them.”\n\nWhile I was on my first mission in Holland, I was invited to speak to a Bible class of businessmen in The Hague. They met every week, holding a Bible class. We met in the home of a prominent furniture dealer; the only woman there was the daughter of the man of the house.\nThey invited me to speak for an hour and a half and explain our doctrine of universal salvation, which includes the work for the dead. I gave them chapter and verse and let them read these passages from their own Bibles so they would believe more completely, as they seemed to think we have a different Bible. Then I closed my Bible and laid it on the table, folded my arms, and waited for their comments.\nThe first comment came from the daughter of the man of the house. She said, “Father, I just can’t understand it. I have never attended one of these Bible classes in my life that you haven’t had the last word to say on everything, and tonight you haven’t said a word.”\nThe father shook his head and said, “My daughter, there isn’t anything to say.” He said, “This man has been teaching us things we have never heard of, and has been teaching them to us out of our own Bibles.”\nThat is what the Lord meant when he said that the prophet he would raise up would not only bring forth his word, but would bring men to the convincing of his word that had already gone forth among them.\nI preached a sermon down in Quitman, Georgia, on the eternal duration of the marriage covenant and the family unit. At the end of the meeting I stood at the door, and a man came up and introduced himself as a minister of the gospel. Since I had quoted what the major churches had to say about that principle, and not one of them believed in the eternal duration of the marriage covenant and the family unit, I said to this minister: “Did I misquote you tonight?”\n“No, Mr. Richards, but it is just like you say, we don’t believe all the things our churches teach.”\nI said, “You don’t believe them either.”\nThen I said, “Why don’t you go back and teach your people the truth. They will take it from you, but they are not ready to take it from the Mormon elders yet.”\nHe said, “I will see you again,” and that was all I could get out of him that night.\nThe next time I went there, about four months later, he was standing out in front of the church. We shook hands. I said, “I would certainly be interested to know what you thought of my last sermon here.”\nHe said, “Mr. Richards, I have been thinking about it ever since. I believe every word you said, only I would like to have heard the rest of it.”\nHere was a man occupying a pulpit in his own church who believed every word I said, and yet he couldn’t teach it to his people.\nI am going to tell you one more experience. A few years ago two of the major churches on the west coast, including California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Utah, and Nevada, were holding a convention here in Salt Lake. Their leader wrote a letter to President McKay and asked if he would send one of the General Authorities to attend their convention and talk for two hours in the morning session and tell them the story of Mormonism, and then remain as their guest for lunch, and then remain for an hour and a half in the afternoon and let them ask questions. I got the assignment—and I was glad to get it! I tell the missionaries that you never need to argue with anybody when you learn how to tell our story.\nSome of these ministers wanted to get away on earlier planes up to the Northwest, so they set the luncheon back a half an hour, and they gave me two and a half hours in that morning meeting. I explained the restoration of the gospel, the difference between a restoration and a reformation, and at the conclusion of my talk I only got one question out of all these ministers and church leaders.\nThe man in charge said, “Mr. Richards, you have told us that you believe that God is a personal God.”\nI said, “That is right.”\nHe said, “We have heard it said that you believe that God has a wife. Would you explain that to us?”\nI think he thought he had me in trouble, and so rather facetiously I said, “I don’t see how in the world he could have a son without a wife, do you?”\nAnd they all began to titter. I didn’t have any more trouble with that question.\nAt the close of my remarks, I told them that while I was the Presiding Bishop of the Church, we had charge of the building program. We had the plans prepared for the Los Angeles Temple. One day we took them and showed them to the First Presidency, but we didn’t have the electrical or plumbing plans completed. We had 84 pages about 4 feet long and 2 1/2 feet wide, and I imagine you have all seen blueprints. I said, “Now you could take those blueprints and try to fit them to every building in this world, but there is only one building they will fit, and that is the Mormon temple down in Los Angeles.” Then I said, “Of course you can find buildings that have material in them such as cement, lumber, electrical wiring, plumbing, and so forth, but you can’t find any building that they will fit.”\nThen I held up the Bible. I said, “Here is the Lord’s blueprint. Isaiah said the Lord had declared the end from the beginning. It is all here. Now,” I said, “you could take this, the Lord’s blueprint, and try to fit it to every church in this world, but there is only one church that it will fit, and that is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Now,” I said, “I will proceed to illustrate to you what I mean.”\nI said that in Canon Frederick William Farrar’s work (Cassell, 1902), he said there were two passages in the New Testament for which he could find no excuse. The first is John 10:16, where Jesus said, “And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.”\nI said, “Do any of you men know why that is in the Bible? Do any of you know any church in the world that does know why it is in the Bible? Well, we know all about it.” And then I explained the promise to Joseph of a new land in the utmost bounds of the everlasting hills, and in describing that land, Moses uses the word precious five times in just a few verses. (See Deut. 33:13–16.)\nI said, “Do any of you know where that land of Joseph is?” Then I explained that it was the land of America, and that Jesus visited his people here in America, and he told them that they were the other sheep of whom he spoke to his disciples. (See 2 Ne. 15:21.) He said that not at any time did the Father command him to tell his disciples who the other sheep were, only that he had other sheep. (See 3 Ne. 15:15–17.)\nThe other passage they couldn’t understand was the one where Paul said, “Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?” (1 Cor. 15:29.) I said, “Do any of you know why that is in the Bible? Do any of you know any church in the world that does know why it is in the Bible?” Then I explained this doctrine to them.\nI quoted to them the words of Peter following the day of Pentecost, when he said to those who had put to death the Christ, “And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.” (Acts 3:20–21.)\nThat is not a reformation; that is a restitution. I said, “That is what I have been telling you here for two hours and a half, and you can’t look for the coming of the Savior as was promised by Peter and the prophets until there has been a restitution, and not a reformation.”\nWhen I concluded, the man in charge said, “Mr. Richards, this has been one of the most interesting experiences of my entire life.” That is what Isaiah meant when he said, “… the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.” (Isa. 29:14.)\nI bear you my witness that there isn’t a man or a woman in this world who really loves the Lord with all their heart who wouldn’t join this church if they would just take time to find out what it is, for I know that it is God’s eternal truth. He has sent his messenger to prepare the way for his coming. I pray God to bless us and help us all to be missionaries. I leave you my blessing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "This is a wonderful sight, brethren, to see so many priesthood holders gathered in one hall, and then to recognize so many gathered throughout the various other chapels and buildings. I am grateful to be with you tonight and to participate in this priesthood meeting.\nOn November 9, 1972, the First Presidency announced the organization of the Melchizedek Priesthood MIA and the Aaronic Priesthood MIA. This decision by the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve will have great impact on the lives of the members of the Church in years to come. President Lee referred to it as potentially one of the most significant changes in the Church in our lifetime. Having been involved in the development of the plan, I can testify to you that it came through inspiration from the Lord.\nIn great measure it fulfills the prophecy of President Joseph F. Smith, who said, “We expect to see the day, if we live long enough (and if some of us don’t live long enough to see it, there are others who will), when every council of the Priesthood in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will understand its duty, will assume its own responsibility, … to the uttermost, according to the intelligence and ability possessed by it. When that day shall come, there will not be so much necessity for work that is now being done by the auxiliary organizations, because it will be done by the regular quorums of the Priesthood. The Lord designed and comprehended it from the beginning, and He has made provision in the Church whereby every need may be met and satisfied through the regular organizations of the Priesthood.” ( April 1906, p. 3.)\nIn the Lord’s eyes the basic responsibility for our young people first rests jointly with parents and with the youth themselves. The Church and its organizations exist to aid parents in their sacred callings. It is in this light that we discuss the Aaronic Priesthood MIA this evening. With this change in organization, the Presiding Bishopric as the presidency of the Aaronic Priesthood, assisted by the Aaronic Priesthood MIA Young Men’s and Young Women’s presidencies and boards, became responsible on the general level for supporting the parents of youth ages 12 to 18. The MIA under this reorganization becomes part of the priesthood and is no longer an auxiliary.\nUntil tonight, this change has been limited to the general level of the Church. It is my great honor and privilege now to introduce this change, as far as the Aaronic Priesthood MIA is concerned, to the stakes, missions, wards, and branches of the Church. What I shall tell you now has the approval and support of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and all of the General Authorities.\nLet us begin with the ward organization. The bishopric is the presidency of the Aaronic Priesthood. This now means the total priesthood responsibility for Aaronic Priesthood MIA in the ward. The bishopric is directly responsible for all young men and women between the ages of 12 and 18. The bishop is president of the priests quorum and responsible for all priest-age boys and Laurel-age girls. One counselor is responsible for all teacher-age boys and Mia Maid-age girls; the other counselor, for the deacon-age boys and Beehive-age girls.\nThe bishopric will call and set apart four adult male leaders. One will be the president of the Aaronic Priesthood MIA Young Men. He will coordinate all activities of the adult youth leaders in the above three age groups under the direction of the bishopric. He will in large measure assume the responsibilities formerly held by the general secretary-Aaronic Priesthood youth. The other three will be advisers to these specific age groups and will be responsible for all their activities and functions. For instance, the deacons’ adviser will teach the deacons quorum in priesthood meeting, be the Scoutmaster, and be involved in the activities of all the 12- through 13-year-old boys. The other two advisers will have the same responsibilities for their age groups.\nThe bishopric will likewise call four adult women leaders. One will be set apart as the president of the Aaronic Priesthood MIA Young Women. The other three will be set apart as advisers to the three age groups, namely, Laurels, Mia Maids, and Beehive girls, just as their counterparts are the advisers to the young men. The Aaronic Priesthood MIA Young Women’s president will then coordinate all activities for the young women under the direct supervision of the bishopric, as does her counterpart for the young men.\nA service and activity committee composed of not more than three men and/or women will be called to function under the direction of both presidents to provide leadership in these areas with special emphasis on service. There is a great desire in the hearts of our young people to be of service to their fellowmen—service such as helping a widow with her yard, taking a family home evening program to an elderly shut-in, helping the poor, the sick, the handicapped, or those who are in emotional distress. This limited committee will also be responsible for the activity projects, such as dance, drama, sports, athletics, etc. These leaders will not be known as drama director, dance director, etc., but will function on a broad base.\n\nWhen the bishopric and Aaronic Priesthood MIA presidents and youth leaders request assistance in service and activity areas, this committee or its members individually will assume the responsibility. The committee will have available to them specialists in various areas of activity on a temporary basis. They may be adults or youth. For instance, a drama night will be directed by a member of the activity committee assisted by a specialist whom the bishop calls for that special project only.\nThe two presidents of the Aaronic Priesthood MIA will each have a secretary to complete the ward organization.\nThe bishop’s youth committee, composed of quorum and class officers, will continue to function but with greater emphasis placed on leadership training for the youth. Young quorum and class presidencies have much to offer if helped to learn and allowed to perform in their callings. It is of the utmost urgency that every bishop in the Church organize his bishop’s youth committee and help them to function effectively in this new organization. Their involvement and contribution are of great importance to this realignment of responsibilities.\nThe bishopric now has more direct priesthood responsibility for all youth of the ward between 12 and 18 than ever before. This responsibility is in partnership with parents, and it is essential that the energy and talent of youth themselves be used.\nThis modified organization is primarily ward oriented.\nIn many aspects the stake organization parallels that of the ward. The stake presidency is the presidency of the Melchizedek and Aaronic priesthoods of the stake. One member of the stake presidency will be appointed chairman of the Aaronic Priesthood MIA of the stake. He will supervise matters involving the youth between 12 and 18 in the stake under the overall direction of the stake presidency.\nFour high councilors will serve under his supervision. One will be designated as the adviser to the Aaronic Priesthood MIA of the stake. This includes young men and young women. There are no Aaronic Priesthood MIA presidents on the stake level. This high councilor will see that the entire youth program of the stake functions properly, of course, reporting to the chairman. A second high councilor adviser will be responsible for the young men of priest age, another of teacher age, and the third of deacon age. They will also work with the advisers of the young women of the same age group.\nThe stake president will call four adult women advisers. One will be set apart as the adviser to the Aaronic Priesthood MIA Young Women of the stake. Another will be the adviser to Laurel-age girls, another to the Mia Maid-age girls, and the fourth the Beehive-age girls. To assist these leaders, there will be an assistant stake clerk for the young men and a young women’s secretary.\nAs on the ward level, a service and activity committee of not more than three adults, men and/or women, will be called. Again, they will not be known as dance or drama directors, etc. They will function under the supervision of the advisers to the Aaronic Priesthood MIA. As needed, they will have specialists available to them on a temporary basis to perform a stake service or activity for a single project. These may be adults or youth. A stake youth committee will be formed as needed to further involve the young people themselves.\nRegional activity for these ages is to be deemphasized. If it seems appropriate to have regional activities, the service will be provided through temporary appointments from the Quorum of the Twelve or, in the case of athletics, through the Melchizedek Priesthood MIA regional organization.\nThese changes have been presented to all Regional Representatives of the Twelve. Bishops and stake presidents will receive more detailed information in the near future, including job descriptions of each position. This organization is to provide experiences that focus on the relationship that youth have with the Savior.\nIn summary, may I list some of the objectives of these changes:\n\nAaronic Priesthood MIA actually is now priesthood oriented.\n\nOur interest is centered on each individual youth, not on programs alone. We must provide activities for those who do not presently come to church as well as for those who do.\n\nDirect involvement of young people themselves is of the utmost importance.\n\nThere will be greater accountability for our stewardship as leaders.\n\nAll that is done is intended to strengthen the family.\n\nFinally, because of the emphasis on people rather than programs, local leaders, both youth and adult, will have the opportunity to determine in great measure the appropriate activities for their young people.\n\nInasmuch as these modifications will be reviewed in detail at June Conference, it is essential that the new stake Aaronic Priesthood MIA organization be implemented as soon as possible so that the proper stake officers will come to conference. We realize there will be limitations of distance as far as attendance at June Conference is concerned, but would hope that all stakes throughout the Church would implement the new organization as soon as possible. Sufficient information will come through the mail for this to be accomplished. Stake leaders will then train ward officers so that the entire program on both the stake and ward levels will be functioning by September 1 of this year. Until instructions come after June Conference, the ward organization and program should continue as at present.\nYou will be interested to know that June Conference is not an auxiliary conference but will be a priesthood conference. The First Presidency will preside and conduct the opening and closing sessions of the conference. President Harold B. Lee will give the keynote address.\nNever has the Lord blessed the earth with a finer generation of youth, nor has there ever been a time when Satan has been more active in influencing the lives of our people. I pray the stake presidencies, bishoprics, and all leaders of youth will sense the urgency of the needs and the lateness of the hour, that we may be magnified and made equal to our responsibilities, that through our love of youth and dedicated leadership, all young men and women in our stakes, wards, and branches may taste the sweetness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and draw close to him in this life so they will be worthy to be with him in the life to come. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "My beloved brethren: Last Saturday I was honored to speak to several hundred young men and women graduating seminary students from the high schools in Utah Valley. Under the leadership of a council of their own peers, they had planned a full day’s activity, which included visits to Welfare Square and the Beehive House, a talent assembly, a devotional and testimony meeting, and a lovely dance. To my knowledge, the only adult who took active part was the area supervisor who introduced me. The rest of the adults present were there to give silent support and, by evening, were feeling their age after sharing a day of youthful vitality and enthusiastic activity.\nI wish every adult leader in the Church could have been in attendance to share the spirit of that testimony meeting. With deep emotion, one lovely girl spoke of her reaction when it was discovered that her father had cancer. How she prayed and prayed that he be healed, then came to the realization that her prayers were selfish—that our loving Father in heaven was in control and that she should submit to his will. She evidenced a very mature outlook on life, something that some of us as adults never experience in a lifetime of living.\nA handsome young man, obviously a football player, told of how his testimony had been strengthened through association with fine, faithful friends, most of them a year older than he. Graduating from high school and soon to be separated from one another, they had a “last fling” together, a visit to the lovely grounds of the Provo Temple. Then they went to a quiet spot where in the late evening hours 12 future leaders of the Church bore their testimonies of the divinity of the gospel and expressed their love for one another.\nI have never heard so many expressions of love for friends and adult leaders who had influenced their lives.\nThe meeting was closed with “I Know That My Redeemer Lives.” I have never heard those beautiful lyrics sung with more genuine feeling. Tears fell freely as those great young people sang from their hearts.\nI mention their experience because it is so typical of many other experiences I have enjoyed among this royal generation of youth. As Bishop Brown has stated, there has never been a finer generation. I have great confidence that the kingdom of God will be in capable hands as they assume their future roles of leadership, and I am equally confident that they now are capable of assuming much more responsibility for their own welfare than we have been willing to give them.\nWith the new direction given to the Aaronic Priesthood MIA program, it now becomes our responsibility as adult leaders to give our youth the opportunity to grow in their capacity to lead, to serve, and to love.\nWhat a challenge adult leaders have in helping youth, particularly youth leaders, to learn their duty and perform to their fullest capacity while still leaving room for their own initiative and challenge as they anxiously engage in a good cause, doing many things of their own free will.\nThe Church leadership of the future will be built upon the foundation that is laid today. If youth are denied opportunities to test their own strength, then the leadership foundation will be weak and unready. Equally as serious, however, is thrusting unprepared youth leaders into situations in which they fail because the demands of that situation exceed their experience and capacity. Discouragement and doubt will result. The balance between enough responsibility and too much calls for fasting, prayer, and diligent service by youth and adult leadership as they labor together to build the kingdom. The Aaronic Priesthood MIA organization as introduced by Bishop Brown provides a setting where such a fine balance may be struck. With the bishopric of the ward—the presidency of the Aaronic Priesthood—in direct charge, the bishop’s youth committee, composed of the priests group leader, the Aaronic Priesthood quorum presidents, the girl class presidents, and the adult presidents of the Aaronic Priesthood MIA, becomes a forum where youth leaders can communicate with the bishopric. They can be totally involved in selecting their activities and be tested and taught great leadership principles without being smothered by too many adult leaders. Yet, this youth committee expands to the ward Aaronic Priesthood council with the addition of the adult leaders of the age groups, who can temper unbridled enthusiasm and zeal with their experience and practicality, exercising some degree of control without dominating the youth councils.\nBishops, an effective youth committee is vital to the success of your Aaronic Priesthood program. It may surprise you what these bright young people will come up with in the way of individual and group service projects and meaningful activities or suggestions for implementing their program.\nIf you have not discovered it yet, you will. Our young men and women have a deep sense of purpose and a keen appreciation for our social needs. They want to be of service; they want to be useful; they want to make this a better world in which to live. Witness the joy of the youth who gathered by the hundreds to clean ditches and gather the debris left by the recent floods in southern Arizona, or those who cleaned up an entire Utah community in a day of service.\nAn active youth committee in Cache Valley made it their project to take care of the aged and shut-ins. Each week the girls would prepare suppers and the boys would prepare lessons or activities to take to the homes of the unfortunate, giving them plenty of tender loving care in a family home evening situation. What do you think that did for those young people to be involved in such a worthy, compassionate service?\nTheir deep desire to be of service and to demonstrate their love can even benefit the bishop. In Sacramento, California, while the bishop was away on vacation with his family, the youth committee determined to paint his house. These young people had the time of their lives working together and anticipating the pleasant surprise of the bishop when he returned. A real bond of love was established between the youth and their bishop with such meaningful service.\nBishops, we urge you to make use of your youth committee; make it the effective instrument it should be to meet the needs of the youth of your ward. I hope every one of you will keep in mind the words President David O. McKay gave us so stirringly: “The spirituality of a ward will be commensurate with the activity of the youth.”\nYou will note, from Bishop Brown’s explanation, that each member of the bishopric has been given a particular age group—both boys and girls—to direct. What a marvelous opportunity this gives for the presidency of the Aaronic Priesthood to help our youth leaders learn the duties and responsibilities of their respective callings. And what a blessing it will be for our youth leaders to enjoy a close relationship with the great youth leaders of the ward.\nTo you Aaronic Priesthood quorum leaders, I hope you understand that the Lord outlined your duties as presidents of the Aaronic Priesthood quorums. He directed you to preside, to sit in council with your quorum members, and to teach them their duty. He didn’t give that assignment to your advisers; he gave it to you. You share the responsibility, with the bishopric, of blessing the lives of every member of your quorum as you fulfill your sacred calling. What a transformation takes place when young Jack Smith becomes President John Smith, deacons quorum president, entitled to revelation from the Lord in directing the affairs of that quorum, and President Smith really assumes the responsibilities of his office. You are too young for such responsibility? The apostle Paul sensed something of the inadequacy young men feel when they are thrust into leadership. He counseled his young “son in the faith,” Timothy, “Let no man despise thy youth. …” (1 Tim. 4:12.)\nDana Miller was approaching his twelfth birthday, looking forward to becoming a deacon. One evening, just prior to his birthday, the front doorbell rang. Dana’s father, a high councilor in the stake, answered the door to find three young men on the porch. “We are the deacons presidency and have come to call on your son, Dana.” Admitting these quorum leaders, Brother Miller retired to another room while the presidency sat down with Dana and outlined his duties and responsibilities as a priesthood holder. That visit had more impact on a boy’s life than hours of counseling from an adult could have. Today Dana is president of the deacons quorum. What kind of a president do you think he is with that kind of an introduction to the priesthood and example from his leaders?\nThe Lord has assured us, “For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves.” (D&C 58:28.)\nMy beloved young brethren, why are we so anxious to have you assume responsibility and learn your duties as priesthood bearers? Perhaps our reason was best stated by Elder Ezra Taft Benson in a speech he delivered to an Explorer conference several years ago. He said: “We are not a church of organized sitters; we are a church of organized workers, and we want you to get into it with all your enthusiasm and power. Young men, my brethren, we want you on the field. We want you sweating it out. We want you to have responsibility because you grow under responsibility.”\nYou royal generation, you special people that God has reserved to come forth in this day, may God bless you with an understanding of who you are and bless you with a knowledge and understanding of the mission that he has in store for you. May your lives reflect that you are disciples of Jesus Christ, and may you, like our elder brother, grow in “wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man” (Luke 2:52), that you will be prepared for the awesome responsibilities that he has before you. I challenge you to do so, to honor your priesthood and to show these good brethren of ours, who are placing increased responsibility on you as bearers of the priesthood, that you are worthy of that honor.\nI bear my witness to you that God is our Father, that he loves you. He has given you the opportunity to come to this life to gain a body and to experience the joys and the sorrows of life that you can return to him and be prepared for even greater service. May God bless all of us who render service to him. May we honor our priesthood and truly represent his cause, I pray humbly in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "year": 1973,
        "content": "My beloved brethren, I am humbled and honored by the transcending privilege of being able to speak to you in this great assemblage of the priesthood.\nI express appreciation to the First Presidency for the assignment that I share with my choice colleagues, Elders Marion D. Hanks and L. Tom Perry, to have concern for the adult single members of the Church over 18 who have, on occasion, been referred to as the “forgotten ones.” I am grateful to our advisers of the Twelve, Elders Thomas S. Monson, Boyd K. Packer, Marvin J. Ashton, and Bruce R. McConkie, for their constant interest and support, and to our director, Jeffrey R. Holland, as well as to the faithful and dedicated members of the general board.\nDuring the past few months, we have spent many hours listening. Most of the single adult members are well adjusted to life and its problems, but they still need the loving attention from the Church and its members to reaffirm their usefulness and the love that God has for each of them. They are not problem people, but many have problems, often not of their own making. A choice friend reminds us, “If you don’t have any problems, just wait awhile.”\nWe have been deeply moved and sobered as we have heard a common thread running through the expressions of many of the single adults. Loneliness and discouragement are for some their most constant companions. One great soul who has a good bishop, a good home teacher, a good position, and comfortable circumstances said, “I don’t need more to do; I just need someone to do it with.” This becomes a matter of great concern when we consider that approximately one-third of the adults in the United States are single.\nThe proper and rightful focus of the Church on the home and the family frequently causes the single members who have no companion and family to feel left out. One writes, “Many members of the Church treat a divorcee as if she had leprosy. I have lived in a certain LDS ward in Salt Lake for several years, where they had a widows’ and widowers’ party every year at Christmas time. I was never invited. I have always lived a good life and believe the Savior would have invited me. I am acquainted with some who have experienced both death and divorce, and they say that divorce is worse than death.”\nStill another writes, “Believe me, with the Church emphasis on families and children, we are already thoroughly aware that we are ‘oddballs.’ It has been a real pleasure to be accepted as a normal person.”\nWe must begin by trying to reach the one—every single individual. We want all to feel that they belong to the Church in the context of Paul’s message to the Ephesians: “… ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God.” (Eph. 2:19.) In our minds we draw two circles: one for the Young Adults, who are of the ages 18 to 25 and include all, whether at home, away from home, on campus, on missions, or in the military, within the circle. We draw another circle and include all of those age 26 and over in the Special Interests, whether never married, widow, widower, or divorced. Everyone who is single belongs in one of these two circles. There are none who are outside the circles.\nBrother Hanks recently reminded us of how the Lord directed Ananias to the one. Ananias was sent to the street called Straight to restore the sight of Saul of Tarsus, stricken blind at the time of his conversion. Ananias responded by reminding the Lord of how much evil Saul had done. The Lord said, “Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me. …” (Acts 9:15.) Paul states that Ananias “came unto me, … and said unto me, Brother Saul. …” (Acts 22:13.)\nSomehow we must reach the one—every single one—for they are “chosen vessels” unto the Lord.\nSpeaking to the single members, President Lee recently said, “In your ranks are some of the noblest members of the Church—faithful, valiant, striving to live the Lord’s commandments, to help build up the kingdom on earth, and to serve your fellowmen.”\nAs we undertake to reach the one, we should remember the counsel of the Lord to Samuel, as he was sent to the house of Jesse to find the one who should reign over Israel. The Lord said to Samuel, “Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature … , for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.” (1 Sam. 16:7.)\nWe believe that each single adult member of the Church may be reached through three fundamental principles: (1) priesthood direction and correlation, (2) individual involvement, and (3) flexibility.\nAll activities will function under the priesthood.\nUnder the principle of individual involvement, priesthood leaders will advise and direct, but should encourage the growth and development of the single adults by delegating to them all appropriate responsibility in conceiving, planning, preparing, and executing their activities. This should be done within the context of the recent teaching of the General Authorities by President Lee, when he referred to the scripture, “Wherefore, now let every man learn his duty. …” (D&C 107:99.) President Lee placed the emphasis on let, in the sense of permitting or allowing those given responsibilities to function within their callings without unnecessary restrictions.\nIt is hoped that priesthood leaders will make things happen by letting or permitting single members to involve themselves in planning and carrying out their activities locally, directed toward service. Through service, wounds can be turned into muscles for living. Leaders from the single members’ groups themselves must be sufficiently innovative and creative to involve each one.\nThere may be complete flexibility in age groupings and in organizing according to their specific interests.\nIt is not intended that detailed programs will be sent out from Church headquarters. We hope to be sending principles, options, and models for local implementation into local programs and to stimulate other activities. Elder Packer suggests that you are being sent a cookbook, rather than a casserole. We will be asking the stake presidents to share their successful recipes with others.\nThere are limitless opportunities and possibilities within the concepts of the principles announced, which can be summed up in the statement of the Prophet Joseph Smith when asked how he governed his people. His response was, “I teach them correct principles, and they govern themselves.”\nThe First Presidency has recently authorized ward leaders to organize single adults not living at home for family home evening, with one designated as the leader. It was made clear that the group should not be called a family and the leader cannot appropriately be designated as a father. Monday evening will be the most convenient for these groups to meet.\nThere has been complete cooperation between Bishop Brown and his counselors directing Aaronic Priesthood MIA, Sister Spafford and her counselors in the Relief Society, and the managing directors of Melchizedek Priesthood MIA. We are all interested in having our combined efforts fit together with all other Church activities in the interest of all members of the Church.\nWithin the next few weeks, priesthood leaders throughout the Church will be receiving more detailed instructions from the First Presidency for the implementation of the adult single members’ activities of the Church. All will wish to study these instructions carefully and to follow them. One stake president, who has been leading out in these activities, recently said, “This program is not more work for the priesthood leaders, but it is an aid to them, if they will let the single members themselves organize and plan their own activities.”\nWhat is proposed is a way to reach the one and have each feel that someone cares and that each has a place in the Lord’s church. Too often we are thoughtless and insensitive to the feelings of these choice souls among us. One well-meaning priesthood leader, concerned about one of these choice single women, whose heart was aching for companionship and a more fulfilling life, asked, “Why don’t you get a husband?” She replied in good humor, “Brother, I would love to, but I can’t go pick one off a tree.”\nReaching the one will involve reaching out in many ways. Recent research indicates that 40 percent of the 18- to 22-year-olds feel that they do not have a single friend they can rely upon. Gerald A. Speedy, commenting on this problem, said, “Think what it would be like not to have a single friend. It is almost impossible to comprehend. Without a friend, a person is in a state of potential crisis.”\nI bear solemn witness to the divinity of this great and marvelous work and to the continuing inspiration that has come from the Lord through his chosen prophet, who has been far ahead of all of the thinking and the planning that has been done. Somehow, some way, we must reach the one, every single one, for they are “chosen vessels” unto the Lord. President Lee’s message to the single members is sublime: “To you, the words of the Master have a special meaning: ‘He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.’” (Matt. 10:39.) That this may be so, I pray humbly in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen."

At the same time, he covenanted with us that if we do so, we shall be “sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of [our] bodies” and “become the sons of … Abraham, and the church and kingdom, and the elect of God,” and unto us shall be given all that the “Father hath.” (See D&C 84:33–38.)\nThe specified penalty for breaking our covenant and “altogether [turning] therefrom” is that we “shall not have forgiveness of sins in this world nor in the world to come.” (D&C 84:41.)\nThe Lord further said to the brethren assembled at the time he revealed the covenant:\n“And I now give unto you a commandment to beware concerning yourselves, to give diligent heed to the words of eternal life.\n“For you shall live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God.” (D&C 84:43–44.)\nIn order to magnify our callings in the priesthood, three things at least are necessary:\nOne is that we have a motivating desire to do so.\nAnother is that we search and ponder the words of eternal life.\nAnd a third is that we pray.\nOver and over again the scriptures teach that men receive from the Lord according to their desires. Alma declared:\n“… I know that [God] granteth unto men according to their desire, whether it be unto death or unto life; yea, I know that he allotteth unto men according to their wills, whether they be unto salvation or unto destruction.” (Alma 29:4.)\nJesus acted on this principle. In John’s parchment record, he wrote:\n“… the Lord said unto me: John, my beloved, what desirest thou? …\n“And I said unto him: Lord, give unto me power over death, that I may live and bring souls unto thee.\n“And the Lord said unto me: Verily, verily, I say unto thee, because thou desirest this thou shalt tarry until I come in my glory, and shalt prophesy before nations, kindreds, tongues and people.” (D&C 7:1–3.)\nAt the opening of this last dispensation, the Lord said to the Prophet’s father: “… if ye have desires to serve God ye are called to the work.” (D&C 4:3.)\nAnd two months later he said to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery: “… as you desire of me so it shall be unto you. …” (D&C 6:8.)\nThe importance of desire is dramatically pointed up in this quotation from the 18th section of the Doctrine and Covenants:\n“And now, behold, there are others who are called to declare my gospel, both unto Gentile and unto Jew;\n“Yea, even twelve; and the Twelve shall be my disciples, and they shall take upon them my name; and the Twelve are they who shall desire to take upon them my name with full purpose of heart.\n“And if they desire to take upon them my name with full purpose of heart, they are called. …\n“And now, behold, I give unto you, Oliver Cowdery, and also unto David Whitmer, that you shall search out the Twelve, who shall have the desires of which I have spoken;\n“And by their desires and their works you shall know them.” (D&C 18:26–28, 37–38. Italics added.)\nThe desire these men were to have was not a desire to be called to an office. It was a desire to take upon themselves the name of Christ “with full purpose of heart.”\nI remember one occasion in the mission field when I was trying to stir an interest in a discouraged missionary. I finally asked him, “Isn’t there anything that you desire?” He said, “Yes, Brother Romney, I desire to be an apostle.”\nNo one should seek to be appointed to any particular office in the Church. Such an aspiration is not a righteous desire; it is a self-serving ambition. We should have a motivating desire to magnify our callings in the priesthood, whatever they may be. We should demonstrate that desire by living the gospel and diligently performing whatever service we are called upon to render. Holding a particular office in the Church will never save a person. One’s salvation depends upon how well he discharges the duties of the service to which he is called. The Prophet Joseph said:\n“From a retrospect of the requirements of the servants of God to preach the Gospel, we find few qualified even to be Priests, and if a Priest understands his duty, his calling, and ministry, and preaches by the Holy Ghost, his enjoyment is as great as if he were one of the Presidency; and his services are necessary in the body, as are also those of Teachers and Deacons.” ( [Deseret Book Co., 1961], p. 112.)\nNor is an effective desire a mere wish. It is not impassive; it is a motivating conviction which moves one to action. One of the things it impels a priesthood bearer to do is to search and ponder the words of eternal life.\nSince we cannot “live by [the words which] proceedeth forth from the mouth of God” unless we know what they are, it is imperative that we study them. This the Lord has directed us to do.\nAs the Jews disputed with Jesus because he said that God was his Father, he pointedly responded: “Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.” (John 5:39.)\nIn the Lord’s preface to his Book of Commandments, he said: “Search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, and the prophecies and promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled.” (D&C 1:37.)\nWe are under divine instruction to “teach the principles of [the] gospel, which are in the Bible and the Book of Mormon.” (D&C 42:12.) This we cannot do unless we know what they are.\nTo Joseph the Prophet, Oliver Cowdery, and John Whitmer, the Lord said: “Behold, I say unto you that you shall let your time be devoted to the studying of the scriptures. …” (D&C 26:1.)\nTo the Saints in Kirtland, he said, concerning the instruction he had given them, “Hearken ye to these words. Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world. Treasure these things up in your hearts, and let the solemnities of eternity rest upon your minds.” (D&C 43:34.)\nAs I have read the scriptures, I have been challenged by the word ponder, so frequently used in the Book of Mormon. The dictionary says that ponder means “to weigh mentally, think deeply about, deliberate, meditate.” Moroni thus used the term as he closed his record:\n“Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things … that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men … and ponder it in your hearts.” (Moro. 10:3. Italics added.)\nJesus said to the Nephites:\n“I perceive that ye are weak, that ye cannot understand all my words. …\n“Therefore, go ye unto your homes, and ponder upon the things which I have said, and ask of the Father, in my name, that ye may understand. …” (3 Ne. 17:2–3. Italics added.)\nPondering is, in my feeling, a form of prayer. It has, at least, been an approach to the Spirit of the Lord on many occasions. Nephi tells us of one such occasion:\n“For it came to pass,” he wrote, “after I had desired to know the things that my father had seen, and believing that the Lord was able to make them known unto me, as I sat pondering in mine heart I was caught away in the Spirit of the Lord, yea, into an exceeding high mountain. …” (1 Ne. 11:1. Italics added.)\nThen follows Nephi’s account of the great vision he was given by the Spirit of the Lord, because he believed the words of his prophet father and had such a great desire to know more that he pondered and prayed about them.\nPresident Joseph F. Smith tells us that “on the third of October, in the year nineteen hundred and eighteen, I sat in my room pondering over the Scriptures. …” He had particular reference at this time to Peter’s statement that Christ “went and preached unto the spirits in prison” (1 Pet. 3:19) while his body lay in the grave.\n“As I pondered over these things which are written,” President Smith continued, “the eyes of my understanding were opened, and the Spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and I saw the hosts of the dead, both small and great. …” He then gives us an account of his great vision concerning missionary work among the spirits of the dead. ( [Deseret Book Co., 1939], p. 472. Italics added.) [D&C 138:1, 11.]\nDesiring, searching, and pondering over “the words of eternal life,” all three of them together, as important as they are, would be inadequate without prayer.\nPrayer is the catalyst with which we open the door to the Savior. “Behold,” he says, “I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.” (Rev. 3:20.)\nFrom the very beginning we have been instructed to pray. The Lord commanded Adam and Eve to “worship the Lord their God,” and he later sent an angel to say to them, “thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore.” (Moses 5:5, 8.)\nJesus instructed the Nephites:\n“Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always lest ye enter into temptation; for Satan desireth to have you, that he may sift you as wheat.\n“Therefore ye must always pray unto the Father in my name;\n“Pray in your families unto the Father, always in my name, that your wives and your children may be blessed.” (3 Ne. 18:18–19, 21.)\nIn this dispensation, even before the Church was organized, the Lord said to the Prophet:\n“Pray always, that you may come off conqueror; yea, that you may conquer Satan, and that you may escape the hands of the servants of Satan that do uphold his work.” (D&C 10:5.)\nHe instructed the priests to “visit the house of each member, and exhort them to pray vocally and in secret. …” (D&C 20:47, 51.)\nOf Church members who went to build up Jackson County, Missouri, he said: “… he that observeth not his prayers before the Lord in the season thereof, let him be had in remembrance before the judge of my people.” (D&C 68:33.)\nAnd finally, he said: “… pray always lest that wicked one have power in you, and remove you out of your place.” (D&C 93:49.)\nIn conclusion, I ask you to listen to Nephi’s exhortation. I hope it moves you as deeply as it does me. He said:\n“… behold, my beloved brethren, …\n“… I said unto you, feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.\n“Wherefore, now after I have spoken these words, if ye cannot understand them it will be because ye ask not, neither do ye knock; wherefore, ye are not brought into the light, but must perish in the dark.\n“And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing. For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray.\n“But behold, I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint; that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul.” (2 Ne. 32:1, 3–4, 8–9.)\nThat the Lord will help each of us bearers of the holy priesthood to acquire such a powerful motivating desire that we will, through searching and pondering upon the words of eternal life and praying about them, be led to magnify our callings in the priesthood, and that we may thereby qualify ourselves to receive the promised blessings of the “covenant which belongeth to the priesthood,” I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "It is a great privilege, honor, and responsibility to stand before and speak to the priesthood assembled in this historic Tabernacle and in the 800 other buildings in the United States and Canada. This is the largest group of priesthood ever gathered to hear the voice of the Prophet, and when we think that they can hear this through closed circuit transmission as he speaks to them, it reminds me that we have an open conduit and a private closed circuit or wave length by which we can speak to our Heavenly Father and hear him, if we keep in tune and try to listen to him.\nI often wonder if we really appreciate what the priesthood means. President Romney, who is so close to the Lord, has given us some instructions tonight which, if we would follow, would help us to appreciate the priesthood and enjoy the blessings of those who magnify their callings in the priesthood. If I should say in my talk tonight to magnify the priesthood, I should like it to mean to be in complete harmony with President Romney, to magnify the priesthood in the office which you hold, because that is what we should do, my brethren. We have this heavy responsibility placed upon us when we are given the priesthood of God.\nEvery time I think of the priesthood, I think of the great honor and privilege we have of speaking and acting in the name of our Heavenly Father, and the responsibility it places upon us. I often say, “What are we going to do about it? Are we going to realize who we are, what we have, and what our responsibilities are?”\nI would like to say to you young men: Have a good time; play basketball, play football; play tennis; play anything you want to play, and do anything you want to do as long as it is right, but honor your priesthood wherever you are, that you might be an example to the world.\nI would like to deal briefly with the question of how we as priesthood holders should live, and I would like to say just a few words first about the family. The father must realize always that the family is the most important thing in his life. He should never neglect his family. As he looks after his family, he should remember that if he is going to enjoy the family now and throughout eternity, it is essential that they live according to the teachings of the gospel, and remember that “no other success can compensate for failure in the home.” Remember too that it is in the home that the most impressive teachings are taught and where the lives of our children are shaped.\nIf the father will love God, love his wife, love his family, and honor his priesthood, he will have very little to worry about. If all the priesthood would do that throughout the world, what a great influence we would have. Some will be saying: “What about the girls, and the mothers, and the women?” The same is true for them, but I am speaking to the priesthood and how they should act.\nKeep the Sabbath day holy. Keep the Word of Wisdom strictly. Pray always, and be honest with one another and with your fellowmen. Study the gospel. Know what is expected of us, why we are here, that we are actually spirit children of God, and as such we must keep ourselves morally clean. And that is one thing, fathers, that we should teach our boys to do.\nI should like to give you, as I speak about the family and fathers, an example by reading what Sister McKay said about President David O. McKay: “I am very, very proud of my husband. He is just as lovely, just as courteous, just as polite, just as kind and just as sweet in our home as he is anywhere else, and I am very proud of him. And I am grateful for him. I cannot see anything wrong with him. I pray that our brethren will try to follow his example in every way, shape, and form.”\nAnd I can’t think of much better advice, brethren, for us to have.\nAs an example of good teaching, I remember a young man telling me one day about his parents and how they taught him the importance of going to the temple and preparing himself to be worthy to go into the house of the Lord by going to the temple regularly. As they were preparing to go to the temple, they would talk about it, and the experiences they would have, and what a great privilege it was to go to the temple, and to go regularly. When they would return from the temple, they would talk about it, and how lovely it was to see a young couple married in the temple, realizing that they could then be parents of spirit children of God, and what a great privilege it was for them to be there in the temple. This boy could hardly wait then for the time to come when he could go in and receive his own endowments, and he knew how important it was to prepare himself to be clean and pure and to go there knowing that the Lord would accept him.\nPersonally, I should like to express the appreciation I have always felt for my father. Father taught us to pray. It seemed that he was talking directly to the Lord when he kneeled down in family prayer. He taught us to pray privately. He was honest and honorable in all of his dealings. I wish I had time to tell you some of the experiences I had to let me know that he was honest and upright in his dealings with his fellowmen. He magnified his priesthood, and he expected us to do it. He always showed great love for Mother.\nHe used to take us hunting or fishing, as busy as we were on the farm. He found it difficult, I am sure, to leave, but he would go with us, and he would never go on Sunday; he never thought of that. We always attended our meetings regularly with him. I remember some of my friends saying, “I wish I had a dad like yours. It is sure great to be with him.” And I can tell you that we boys—there were four of us—would rather be with our dad than anybody else because he was a good father. Fathers, it is important that you be with your boys so they can see how you live, and you can see how they live.\nI remember Father’s placing confidence in me. We used to work on the farm, as I said before, and he would call me in the evening or early morning to discuss his plans, his program for the day, and ask me what I thought about it. Should we do this or should we do that? I felt that I was a part of it. I know now that he had his plans pretty well formed, but he showed that confidence in me. And realizing that I was part of it, I worked my head off to accomplish it, and I loved my dad for it.\nAnd then I remember him saying to me one day, “You know, my son, I would rather have you helping me than any hired man I have. I have full confidence in you, and you surely do a good day’s work.” Such an expression of confidence and appreciation makes one more determined to do well what he is expected to do.\nIt is very important that we help our boys set their goals high and then set about to reach them. We must understand that Satan is there and is real, as has been told us twice tonight, and is determined to destroy us, to discourage us, to tempt us, and to lead us astray.\nI should like to repeat a beautiful experience, which is very touching to me. I hope Bishop Featherstone won’t mind my mentioning him as the one about whom I am going to speak. This happened just after they moved here from their lovely home, where they had many friends and were very popular. He had come home after work and had gotten into his lounging clothes, and his young son, Joe, said, “Dad, I wish you would give me a special blessing so that I can adjust and feel at home and be happy here.”\nHis father went upstairs and changed his clothes. As he was coming down, his wife said, “Surely you are not going out tonight.” He said, “I am going to give someone a blessing.” And then he said, “Joe has asked for a special blessing, and I wanted to be dressed and ready to honor the priesthood and to show Joe the interest I have in him, and to make it possible for him to enjoy the blessings through the faith he has in me and the priesthood.”\nBrethren, that is the spirit to have. And, of course, as he told his wife, you can naturally imagine what happened. She shed tears as she realized she had a husband, the father of her son, who would be an example and be so interested in him that he would be prepared to represent the Lord in the priesthood that he holds.\nI would like to say just a few words to the bishops, to the other officers in the wards and stakes, including the stake presidents, and to mission presidents. We have a heavy responsibility; and especially the bishop, with his counselors, has the responsibility for the Aaronic Priesthood. Much has been said about that tonight, but I would like to say just a few words. You should know every boy by his first name. Show an interest in him; stay close to him. When you know his first name, use it. You remember when God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph, and he asked the question, God turned to him and said, “Joseph,” calling him by name, “this is my beloved Son.” (See JS—H 1:17.) A boy likes to hear his name called.\nLet us remember and remind our boys always, when they are officiating as holders of the priesthood, that they are representing the Lord. They can have their good times every other place and play the way they want to do, but when they are officiating in the priesthood, they should realize that they are representing the Lord, and be so dressed and so prepared and humble and reverent as to properly represent him.\nAnd bishops, it is important that we help them to understand and appreciate what the priesthood means. When I was a bishop I had six boys in my ward old enough to be ordained elders. I could only recommend five of them, because one of them wasn’t ready. We had talked about it several times, and he had said to me, “I am not worthy.” He felt very bad about it, but he didn’t expect to be recommended to the stake president. His uncle came to me and said, “You are surely not going to hold that boy back with his five friends going forward.” He pled with me to let him go. He said, “You will be driving him out of the Church if you don’t.”\nI explained to this man, “The priesthood is the most important thing that we can give this boy. We are not handing the priesthood out on a silver platter. This boy and I understand each other, and he is not ready to be ordained an elder.” And he wasn’t recommended.\nA few years later I was attending a general conference right here on this Temple Square, and a young man came up to me and said, “President Tanner, you wouldn’t remember me. I am the boy whom you didn’t recommend to be ordained an elder.” As he put his hand out, he said, “I want to thank you for it. I am a bishop now in California. If you had recommended me when I wasn’t worthy, I possibly never would have appreciated what the priesthood is and what is expected of one, and surely I would never have been a bishop as I am today.”\nBishops, these young men don’t expect something for nothing. They don’t appreciate anything they get for nothing, and they should realize and appreciate just what the priesthood means and then be prepared to qualify and be worthy before they are advanced.\nBy a searching interview, know that they are ready for a temple recommend, for advancement in the priesthood, for a mission, or anything that you are considering them for, and be sure they are ready. It is certainly no kindness to recommend someone when he is not ready—in fact, it is a great disservice and it shouldn’t be done. Help them to appreciate what it means and the importance of being ready and worthy. Encourage them, let them know that you love them, and do all you can to help them prepare.\nI would like to say, bishops, that as fathers of the wards you have the great privilege, the great joy of directing all the affairs in the ward and of helping these young men to become the kind of young men who will be the leaders in the ward and in the stake, and someday sitting on this stand—some of them certainly will be. Help them to prepare and help them to appreciate that they might be holding responsible positions. And let me say this to you tonight: It is not possible for everyone holding the priesthood to be called to positions of leadership, but holding the priesthood of God is a great privilege, a great blessing, and it alone, if we honor it, will prepare us for salvation and exaltation, if we are ready to serve the Lord wherever we are called. The priesthood of God is something the world doesn’t have.\nBishops, you have an additional responsibility. You are judges in Israel, and you should always judge and deal with the transgressor with love and confidence, with a desire in your heart to help him, and carry out your responsibilities to deal with him. Stake and mission presidents also have this responsibility. It is important that when you know there is iniquity, you be kind enough to show an interest in the transgressor and bring him to repentance, and that is a kindness. Love all, but tolerate no iniquity. When it appears that something is wrong, it is your duty to investigate and handle all cases of transgression according to the seriousness of the case. By moving promptly, you might be able to prevent further transgression.\nStudy the scriptures and the handbook and do as they direct. Bishops and stake presidents must not shirk this responsibility. Anyone who says that he has never disciplined, disfellowshipped, or excommunicated anyone, and that he never intends to, has an entirely wrong attitude and may himself be held accountable.\nThe Lord has said, “Any member of the church of Christ transgressing, or being overtaken in a fault, shall be dealt with as the scriptures direct.” (D&C 20:80.)\nAnd President John Taylor said this: “Furthermore, I have heard of some Bishops who have been seeking to cover up the iniquities of men; I tell them, in the name of God, they will have to bear them themselves, and meet that judgment; and I tell you that any man who tampers with iniquity, he will have to bear that iniquity, and if any of you want to partake of the sins of men, or uphold them, you will have to bear them. Do you hear it, you Bishops and you Presidents? God will require it at your hands. You are not placed in a position to tamper with the principles of righteousness, nor to cover up the infamies and corruptions of men.” ( April 1880, p. 78.)\nThe cases that are to be handled by the Church include but are not limited to fornication, adultery, homosexual acts, abortion, or other infractions of the moral code; intemperance; criminal acts involving moral turpitude, such as burglary, dishonesty, theft, or murder; apostasy; open opposition to and deliberate disobedience of the rules and regulations of the Church; cruelty to spouse or children; advocating or practicing so-called plural marriage; or any un-Christianlike conduct in violation of the law and order of the Church.\nThose who are guilty of transgression are never happy until they confess their sins and repent. Experience has proven that every transgressor who is dealt with as he should be, with love and a desire to help and with the proper discipline, is able to start out anew with a clear conscience and can then and only then progress as he could not do otherwise. He will thank you for it, and as you try to help him, the Lord will bless both you and the repentant individual.\n\nI would like to say just a few words to the boys and young men as priesthood holders—the young men particularly. You have been told what your responsibility is tonight. I want to impress upon you the importance of keeping morally clean. Prepare yourselves for the great blessings that come only through the priesthood, such as temple blessings, filling missions, and doing other things that you can do in the offices you hold. No man, young or old, who holds the priesthood of God can honor that priesthood without honoring and respecting womanhood. Any young man should be prepared to protect a woman’s virtue with his life, if necessary, and never be guilty of lusting after a woman or doing anything that would degrade her or cause her to lose her virtue. Every young woman has a perfect right to feel safe in going out with a young man holding the priesthood, knowing that he will respect and protect her in every way.\nWe all know that the morals of the world are loose. Though we are in the world, we must not be of it. Whether your associates are members of the Church or not, and whether or not they are transgressors, they will expect you who hold the priesthood to honor that priesthood and will respect you if you do. Otherwise, they lose confidence in you and respect for you and for the Church.\nIf we would live each day so that we could look the bishop, branch president, the stake president, the president of the Church, or the Lord in the eye and say, “I am doing my best to magnify my priesthood,” then we would be safe.\nNo young man guilty of serious transgression should apply for a temple recommend or expect to be called on a mission or wish to be advanced in the priesthood until he has repented and is worthy of such a call. I can think of no greater disappointment, sadness, or sorrow that can come to anyone than to have a missionary who is not worthy, not dedicated, and guilty of transgression, be sent home dishonorably released, disfellowshipped, or excommunicated. This is a great disappointment to his companion, and it makes the mission president’s heart bleed to have to deal with one of his missionaries who is guilty of transgression either before coming or while in the mission field, and then to have the difficult responsibility of sending him home. It distresses the parents and grieves the bishop and stake president and those with whom he has worked so closely. It is an affront to the Lord and seriously affects the life of the missionary.\nMay the Lord help us to appreciate who we are and to live accordingly, realizing that we do hold the priesthood of God in the church of Jesus Christ, the only men in the world who hold the authority to speak in God’s name. Assembled here tonight in these different buildings, every priesthood office of the Church is represented, and the success and progress of this church depend on you as individuals who hold the priesthood. May we prove worthy, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "We have here Captain Larry J. Chesley, Major Jay C. Hess, and Lieutenant Commander David J. Rollins. Will you stand up, please? Captain Chesley, United States Air Force, was a prisoner of war for seven years. He comes from the Burley Stake, Star Ward. Major Jay Hess, United States Air Force, was a prisoner of war for six years, from Bountiful East Stake. Lieutenant Commander Rollins, United States Navy, a prisoner of war for six years, is from the San Diego North Stake.\nThese three young men represent many of those boys who have gone through the fire of adversity. We just want you men to know that our hearts have been touched by the announcement of your faith, your confidence in your country and in your commander-in-chief, that you have come through thus far. We want to say to you that we have been praying, we have been hoping with every means at our command; and we now say to the priesthood, brethren, will you put your arms around these boys, and help them now to make their adjustments as may be necessary in their homecoming.\nThe Lord bless you, brethren. We love you and the many others who have been in these circumstances and have come through the fire, and have now been prepared to go forward. You will be the kind of men that we look to for the standards of our youth in the years that lie ahead. Thank you, brethren. We welcome you home.\nOur hearts go out to the many others, to the mothers and fathers in the thousands of homes where the boys didn’t come home. We are having an Easter program where they have asked me to respond, seeing what might be done to ease the aching hearts of the thousands of others who didn’t come home. There is hope. Thank God for the promise of the gospel and the blessings that lie beyond the grave.\nJust a word now about what has been said regarding the Aaronic Priesthood MIA and the Melchizedek Priesthood MIA. I am sure that you listened to President Romney and heard him define that word ponder, and then made its application; that is what we are asking you to do now, and not go out as a Monday morning quarterback and try to do all the second-guessing. I want to say to you that there is no topic that has received longer and more searching, prayerful discussion by the General Authorities of the Church than the matters that pertain to the young people of the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthood groups, and the women of similar ages.\nMay I just make this one statement, so that you will get this thing in proper focus. These announced Aaronic Priesthood and Melchizedek Priesthood MIAs do not do away with the Young Men’s and Young Women’s Mutual Improvement Associations. What is intended, as you see this unfold, is that the programs will go forward, but with priesthood identity the like of which they have not enjoyed before. And we sincerely believe that if you fully understand and this program is fully comprehended, as the priesthood identity is now explained, many of those who have not been active will now be brought into activity; and the priesthood and the youth and the young adults, and those over 25, and many others who have felt themselves forgotten souls will now, under the leadership of these great leaders, move forward. We hope that there will not one be missed, and everybody will be taken into focus by the great plan of salvation.\nAs I have gone out to youth conferences on various occasions, I have asked, “What is your greatest problem?” And surprisingly, the leaders have always said something like this: “We want to have you put all the youth organizations belonging to the same church together.” We have had our campus stakes, institutes, M Men and Gleaners, Delta Phi, Lambda Delta Sigma, Latter-day Saint Student Associations, all of them, and sometimes the same ones clamoring to be with the others in the group. Institutionalized, these same groups will still function as far as religious activities are concerned; but so far as the activity part of the program, the social part, is concerned, we trust that as you see this move into action, you will see that our youth of these various organizations, of these various groupings, will now be brought together so that there will be a wider relationship than there has ever been before. Hopefully there will be a greater chance for young people to find companionship within their groups, and eventually, we hope, in temple marriage.\nSuspend judgment, then, and ponder what has been said tonight until you receive further instructions, which will be given you in detail, as the brethren have explained.\nI have a letter from some man who seemingly has found something in the hieroglyphics of some discovery that is the answer to a lot of the things that lay ahead for the world. And interestingly enough, as I looked at this, my mind reflected back to an address I heard delivered from this pulpit by President Anthony W. Ivins on October 4, 1931. Just why I thought of that—I suppose it was intended that I should—is because he gave an address at that conference and used as his text the recently published book called Many of you remember this treated principally the erection, the symbolism, and the prophetic character of the pyramid of Gizeh, or in Greek, the Cheops. Students of the pyramid, after a study of the measurements, symbols, and the record of the pyramid, if it had a record, said that the year 1928 would witness the beginning of a period of great tribulation, which would culminate with intensity in 1936. That period, according to the reckoning of the students, would close with the advent of the Lord and the establishment of a period of peace, happiness, and goodwill among men.\nThen President Ivins gave these wise words of counsel with reference to this book: “Now, my brethren … I have referred to this little book and its contents as I desire that you might understand. It will undoubtedly go into the mission field and our elders may make use of it. I simply want to warn you against sensationalism of any kind. … I do not say that his conclusions are wrong, but I do say that they do not come to us as the voice of the Church, nor are they to be accepted as such.”\nThen he said something that seems very significant to me. He said: “Brother J. Golden Kimball told us yesterday that he was a great believer in dreams that come true.” I wish you would think of that. That accords with my feelings. I am a great believer in dreams that have come true.\n“I am reminded of the fact,” he said, “that immediately after the close of the World War these students of the Pyramids announced and published it that according to their measurements and calculations there would begin in the year 1928 a period which would bring tribulation and sorrow to the people of the world; that they would be required to humble themselves before the Lord, and that that period of tribulation would continue until the year 1936. … We all know that a part of this dream at least has come true.”\nAfter commenting on the financial condition throughout the nations at that time, in the 1930s, President Ivins then concluded his remarks with these profound words of wisdom: “Well, now, my brethren and sisters, what about it all? Just be calm and turn to the Lord. … I pleaded with the people to put their houses in order and get out of debt, for I knew this was coming, because God himself through his Only Begotten Son had declared it.\n“Now, my brethren and sisters, if the Church has anything to say to you it will come from them direct and not from the writings of other men. It will come to you in a manner that you will understand it. It will not be speculative. It will come to you philosophically, truthfully, and governed by common sense. God bless you,” he said, “is my humble prayer. …” ( October 1931, pp. 87–94.)\nNow this is something that needs repeating to this great body of priesthood, because we have a rash of writings by certain persons who claim to be of good standing in the Church, going into considerable detail as they recite their past and present Church affiliations and activities in the foreword, interlude, and advertising. There are sensational predictions and observations, and to make their writings appear to have Church sanction, they use quotations and addresses from Church leaders, past and present, taken out of context in such a way as to make it appear as though these quotations were the endorsement of the book they wish to sell to Church members, who may thereby be induced to accept their writings as from unquestioned sources.\nNow we have also had some who claim to be in good standing in order to take advantage of the gathering of the Saints at some of our general conferences, and who have gone so far as to program group meetings for their own interest, with the obvious hope that by doing so, many of our conference visitors may be urged to attend their meetings, even if it may have necessitated their absence from vitally important instructional sessions of the conference.\nFurthermore, some designing individuals have solicited opportunities to speak at church gatherings, firesides, priesthood quorums, sacrament meetings. Now, brethren, we feel it is of the utmost importance to lift a warning voice so that our people will be safeguarded against such tactics as an all too obvious self-seeking opportunity to spread their own propaganda for their own interests.\n\nWe must urge that priesthood leaders use careful discretion in screening out those whose motives may be subject to serious questions.\nNow a word about magnifying the priesthood. Much has been said about that tonight. I would like to read a portion of a short revelation given through the Prophet Joseph Smith to Edward Partridge in 1830:\n“Thus saith the Lord God, the Mighty One of Israel: Behold, I say unto you, my servant Edward, that you are blessed, and your sins are forgiven you, and you are called to preach my gospel as with the voice of a trump;\n“And I will lay my hand upon you by the hand of my servant Sidney Rigdon, and you shall receive my Spirit, the Holy Ghost, even the Comforter, which shall teach you the peaceable things of the kingdom;\n“And now this calling and commandment give I unto you concerning all men—\n“That as many as shall come before my servants Sidney Rigdon and Joseph Smith, Jun., embracing this calling, … shall be ordained and sent forth to preach the everlasting gospel among the nations. …\n“And this commandment shall be given unto the elders of my church, that every man which will embrace it with singleness of heart may be ordained and sent forth, even as I have spoken.\n“I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God; wherefore, gird up your loins, and I will suddenly come to my temple. …” (D&C 36:1–2, 4–5, 7–8.)\nNow, I want to refer particularly to this one verse, and then make a few comments about magnifying the priesthood. Notice what the Lord said: “And I will lay my hand upon you [Edward Partridge] by the hand of my servant Sidney Rigdon, and you shall receive my Spirit, the Holy Ghost, even the Comforter, which shall teach you the peaceable things of the kingdom.”\nThe other night I had a group of young Cub Scouts, who are about the age to become ordained deacons, and I said to these young men, “When you get to be deacons, what will be the duties of a deacon?”\nAnd they all said, “The duty of the deacon is to pass the sacrament.”\nAnd I said, “Now I would like you to think of this a little differently. That isn’t the way to explain the duty of a deacon. What does it mean to pass the sacrament? When a deacon carries the emblems of the bread and water which have been blessed to the good of those to whom it shall be passed, it is then a renewal of a covenant that if they will keep the commandments of God and remember the Lord Jesus Christ, for whom those emblems stand, they will have the Spirit of the Lord to be with them.”\nA deacon, then, has the responsibility of representing the Lord to carry these emblems and thus be the Lord’s agent in submitting these to the body of the Church.\nWhen you ask a teacher what are his duties, he may answer, “Well, it’s to do home teaching.” But suppose you say to him, “When you do home teaching you are representing the Lord, to visit the home of each member, to see that they are doing their duty, and to see that they are all keeping the commandments of God.” The duties of a priest: The priest “is to preach, teach, expound, exhort, and baptize, and administer the sacrament, and visit the house of each member, and exhort them to pray vocally and in secret and attend to all family duties.” (D&C 20:46–47.) They should have in mind when they are acting in those capacities, it is as though they were acting for and responsible to the Lord.\nWhen we officiate in the name of the Lord, as holders of the priesthood, we are doing it in the name and in behalf of our Heavenly Father. Priesthood is the power by which our Heavenly Father works through men, through deacons, through teachers, through priests, and I have a feeling that we are not impressing that upon our young men. They are not taking the understanding of their priesthood as seriously as they might. If they did, they would always want to appear as President Tanner has said of Bishop Featherstone. They would always want to appear at their best when they are exercising their priesthood. Their hair would be properly groomed; their clothing and appearance would reflect the sanctity they should feel in the performance of their priesthood duties. I have had that same feeling. I have never performed an ordinance, such as administering to the sick, without first excusing myself, if I were out in the garden or somewhere, until I was properly clothed, to make the best appearance I could, because I felt in so doing I was drawing close to the Lord himself, and I want to appear at my best in his presence.\nBrethren, I am afraid that some of our elders do not understand this, that when they are officiating as elders of the Church, or as seventies or as high priests, it is as though when they perform the ordinance, the Lord through them is acting upon the heads of those for whom they minister. I have often thought one of the reasons why we are not magnifying our priesthood is because we don’t understand that as holders of the priesthood, He is working through us by the power of the holy priesthood, and I would wish that we could all have that feeling, and so teach our young people what it means to hold the priesthood and to magnify it.\nNow tonight, brethren, we have touched a number of subjects. We come to you, one of the greatest bodies of priesthood that has ever been assembled, so we understand. What an influence! At the sessions of this conference you have had your attention called to some of the most dangerous trends in our public life—sex education, pornography, permissiveness—running rampant over the world. Brethren of the priesthood, this army, if they would reach out with all the influence that they could wield and really magnify their priesthood as the representatives of our Heavenly Father, could engender such a power and might that by the use of our priesthood in our various communities, these things would not be allowed to continue without a sturdy defense on the part of the priesthood of the living God.\nWe must call ourselves to new service and new responsibilities, and not stand idly by and let these things go without challenge. Our youth are in danger. Keep your home ties strong, brethren. See to it, as we have all tried to say, and as I have repeated it many times and some have quoted it in this conference, that “the greatest of the Lord’s work you brethren will ever do as fathers will be within the walls of your own home.” Don’t neglect your wives, you brethren. Don’t neglect your children. Take time for family home evening. Draw your children around about you. Teach them, guide them, and guard them. There was never a time when we needed so much the strength and the solidarity of the home. If we will do that, this church will grow by leaps and bounds in strength and influence throughout the world. No longer need you be considered as a hiss and byword. We should stand four-square for the things that are honorable, righteous, pure, virtuous, and true.\nBrethren of the priesthood, we love you. We stand ready. As you pray for us, we will try to meet that high expectation, God being our helper. We realize the magnitude of the responsibility we bear, and except we can be assured of your faith and your loyalty, and your unquestioned one hundred percent keeping of the commandments of God, we cannot meet it.\nI quoted in the opening session of this conference a wonderful letter that I received from a student body president who is greatly concerned about things going on on the campus and ’round about in the society where he moves, and then his statement was, “I can assure you that every Latter-day Saint on this campus who is keeping the commandments of God one hundred percent is supporting and sustaining you.” Brethren, I know that that is true throughout this whole church. Every Latter-day Saint who is keeping the commandments is following the leadership of the Church. By that same token, if you find those who are not willing to follow the leadership of the Church, you may be sure it is a certainty that they are not keeping the commandments of God one hundred percent.\nSo it is a call to arms—arms to do what? To keep the commandments of God in order that we might lay claim to the blessings we need so much in this day of uncertainty, in this crazy mixed-up world, as some have spoken of it, and our youth have seemed to feel. In these new movements with our young people, our only hope is that by intensifying the responsibility of the priesthood with the youth organizations we can strengthen their hands and reach out to these young men and women who need so much the shepherding influence of the priesthood, for in so doing we feel sure we can help to raise up a righteous generation that will carry on the work throughout the ages that lie ahead of us.\nI bear you my solemn witness, my beloved brethren, that these things that have been spoken tonight have been spoken under the inspiration of the Lord, and we give it to you for your pondering, for your prayerful consideration, suspending judgment, and not raising your voices in criticism, but carrying on the youth organizations as they now exist until these brethren have given you the full details of just what lies ahead; then you can begin to see the merits of what it is all about.\nSo I bear you that witness and leave you my blessing this night, and pray God’s blessings upon you, the priesthood of the Church, the strength of Zion, the backbone of the kingdom of God on earth. So I pray and leave you my blessing, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "year": 1973,
        "content": "My beloved brothers, sisters, and friends, members and nonmembers, wherever you are: I have a very important message for you today, but what I say will be but words unless we enjoy the Spirit of the Lord. I therefore invite you to join with me in a prayer that the Lord will bless us all while I speak.\nThe truth I desire to emphasize today is that we mortals are in very deed the literal offspring of God. If men understood, believed, and accepted this truth and lived by it, our sick and dying society would be reformed and redeemed, and men would have peace here and now and eternal joy in the hereafter.\nMembers of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints accept this concept as a basic doctrine of their theology. The lives of those who have given it thought enough to realize its implications are controlled by it; it gives meaning and direction to all their thoughts and deeds. This is so because they know that it is the universal law of nature in the plant, animal, and human worlds for reproducing offspring to reach in final maturity the likeness of their parents.\nThey reason that the same law is in force with respect to the offspring of God. Their objective is, therefore, to someday be like their heavenly parents.\nThey not only so reason; they know they may so become because God has revealed the fact that it is his work and glory to bring to pass their eternal life (Moses 1:39), which is the life God lives.\nAdam, the first man, knew that he was a son of God. He walked and talked with him in the Garden of Eden before the fall. After the fall, “Adam and Eve, his wife, called upon the name of the Lord, and they heard the voice of the Lord from the way toward the Garden of Eden, speaking unto them. …” (Moses 5:4–5.)\nLater, the Lord sent an angel who taught them the gospel plan, whereupon, “Adam and Eve blessed the name of God, and they made all things known unto their sons and their daughters.” Then “Satan came among them, saying: … Believe it not; and they believed it not, and they loved Satan more than God. And men began from that time forth to be carnal, sensual, and devilish.” (Moses 5:12–13.)\nFrom then until now, most men, like the first generation of Adam’s posterity, have “believed it not,” although God has repeatedly revealed it to all the prophets from Adam to Noah. He likewise revealed it to Abraham and thereafter to Moses “at a time when Moses was caught up into an exceedingly high mountain,\n“And he saw God face to face, and he talked with him, …\n“And God spake unto Moses, saying: Behold, I am the Lord God Almighty, …\n“… behold, thou art my son; …\n“And I have a work for thee, Moses, my son; and thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten; and mine Only Begotten is and shall be the Savior, for he is full of grace and truth; …\n“And now, behold, this one thing I show unto thee, Moses, my son; for thou art in the world, and now I show it unto thee.” (Moses 1:1–4, 6–7. Italics added.)\nIn this short scripture, the Lord three times addressed Moses as “my son.”\nPaul, in his great speech on Mars’ hill, speaking of God, said: “… in him we live, and move, and have our being; … for we are … his offspring.” (Acts 17:28.)\nJoseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon declared “that he lives!\n“For we saw him, … and we heard the voice bearing record …\n“That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God.” (D&C 76:22–24.)\n“Begotten sons and daughters unto God.” Can this be true in light of the fact that we all know that we are begotten sons and daughters of our earthly fathers? Yes, it is true because human souls are dual beings—spirits tabernacled in bodies of flesh and bone. The revelation says, “… the spirit and the body are the soul of man.” (D&C 88:15.) God is the father of man’s spirit, even as his earthly father is the father of his mortal body.\nThe nature of a spirit is plainly revealed in the scriptures. A clear word picture of a spirit is recorded in the third chapter of Ether in the Book of Mormon, which gives an account of the appearance of Jesus Christ, as a spirit, some 2200 years before he was born to Mary in the flesh. The record says that Jesus stood before the brother of Jared in the form and likeness of a man and said:\n“… Behold, I am Jesus Christ. …\n“… Seest thou that ye are created after mine own image? Yea, even all men were created in the beginning after mine own image.\n“Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and man have I created after the body of my spirit; and even as I appear unto thee to be in the spirit will I appear unto my people in the flesh.” (Ether 3:14–16.)\nCorroborating this truth, Jesus declared to Joseph Smith as late as 1833:\n“… I was in the beginning with the Father, and am the First-born [meaning, of course, the firstborn spirit];\n“Ye were also in the beginning with the Father; that which is Spirit. …” (D&C 93:21, 23.)\nWe learn something more about our spirits in their premortal state from a record made by Abraham of a vision in which he was shown a multitude of spirits assembled in a great heavenly council. Consideration was there being given to the creation of this earth as a place upon which they, the spirits, could come and receive bodies of flesh and bone, thus becoming human souls. The plan provided that after a probationary period in mortality they should die—that is to say, their eternal spirit bodies and their corruptible mortal bodies would be separated. Later on, in resurrection, they would be reunited as immortal souls.\nAbraham also learned that if during their sojourn on this earth they proved faithful, they would, as resurrected beings, be permitted to come back into the presence of their Heavenly Father—the Father of their spirits—and enjoy eternal progression. These are the words of Abraham:\n“Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; …\n“And God saw these souls that they were good, … and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, … and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born.\n“And there stood one among them that was like unto God [and this was Jesus Christ, the firstborn spirit], and he said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;\n“And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them;\n“And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon [this refers to us; we kept our first estate and were added upon by receiving mortal bodies]; … and they who keep their second estate [that is, this life] shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever.” (Abr. 3:22–26.)\nSuch is the revealed truth concerning man’s lofty estate.\nBy way of contrast, consider Alexander Pope’s portrayal of the predicament into which man has fallen, as a result of his having rejected the revealed word of God as to his identity. Pope pictures him as being—\n\n“Placed on this isthmus of a middle state,\nA being darkley wise and rudely great:\nWith too much knowledge for the Sceptic side,\nWith too much weakness for the Stoic’s pride,\nHe hangs between, in doubt to act or rest;\nIn doubt to deem himself a God or Beast;\nIn doubt his mind or body to prefer;\nBorn but to die, and reas’ning but to err;\nAlike in ignorance, his reason such,\nWhether he thinks too little or too much;\nChaos of thought and passion, all confused;\nStill by himself abused or disabused;\nCreated half to rise, and half to fall;\nGreat Lord of all things, yet a prey to all;\nSole judge of truth, in endless error hurl’d;\nThe glory, jest, and riddle of the world! …\n\n“Fix’d like a plant on his peculiar spot,\nTo draw nutrition, propagate, and rot. …\n\n“On life’s vast ocean diversely we sail,\nReason the card, but Passion is the gale. …\n\n“And hence one Master-passion in the breast,\nLike Aaron’s serpent, swallows up the rest.”\n\n—“An Essay on Man,” Epistle II\n\nThe theory that man is other than the offspring of God has been, and, so long as it is accepted and acted upon, will continue to be, a major factor in blocking man’s spiritual growth and in corrupting his morals.\nThat it would be so was clearly predictable. In the mind of its devotee, any such theory as Pope’s doubt as to whether “to deem himself a God or Beast” is resolved in favor of being a beast; and his doubt as to whether to prefer “his mind or body,” in favor of his body.\nThe concept that man is a beast relieves him of a sense of accountability and encourages him to adopt the fatalistic attitude of “eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die.” He becomes, in truth, as Pope says:\n\n“Fix’d like a plant on his peculiar spot,\nTo draw nutrition, propagate, and rot. …\n\n“On life’s vast ocean diversely we sail,\nReason the card, but Passion is the gale\n\n“And hence one Master-passion in the breast,\nLike Aaron’s serpent, swallows up the rest.”\n\nThe truth is, my beloved brethren and sisters, man is a child of God—a God in embryo. Every righteous soul responds with empathy to the children singing:\n\n“I am a child of God,\nAnd he has sent me here, …\nIf I but learn to do his will\nI’ll live with him once more.\n\n“Lead me, guide me, walk beside me,\nHelp me find the way.\nTeach me all that I must do\nTo live with him some day.”\n\n—Naomi W. Randall\n\nThat man is a child of God is the most important knowledge available to mortals. Such knowledge is beyond the ken of the uninspired mind. Neither logic, science, philosophy, nor any other field of worldly learning has ever been, or ever will be, able to find it out. Those who limit their search to such learning techniques will continue to be as they have always been, “Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.” (2 Tim. 3:7.)\nThe only means by which such knowledge can be had is divine revelation. Fortunately for us, as has already been shown, it has been so revealed repeatedly from Adam until today.\nThe aspirations, desires, and motivations of one who accepts, believes, and by the power of the Holy Spirit obtains a witness to the truth that he is a begotten son or daughter unto God differs from the aspirations of him who believes otherwise, as the growing vine differs from the severed branch.\nKnowing that he is a child of God, one does not doubt whether to “deem himself a God or Beast.” He is not of “chaos … thought,” driven by “passion” and “all confused.” He is not “fix’d like a plant on his peculiar spot, to draw nutrition, propagate, and rot.” He thinks of himself, as the scriptures teach, possessed of the innate ability, as are all other reproducing offspring, to reach in final maturity the status of his heavenly parents and have “glory added upon [his] head for ever and ever.” (Abr. 3:26.) This is his goal.\nHe accepts the Ten Commandments, the Sermon on the Mount, the Word of Wisdom, and every other direction and commandment given of God to be statements of laws, the observance of which is indispensable to the attainment of his goal, to reach which he has dedicated his life.\nHe strives to respond to the Master’s invitation:\n“Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” (Matt. 11:28.)\nAnd to his challenge:\n“… be [ye] perfect even as I, or your Father who is in heaven is perfect.” (3 Ne. 12:48.)\nHe knows that the wise and proper response is to heed the Lord’s command to “beware concerning yourselves, to give diligent heed to the words of eternal life. For you shall live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God.” (D&C 84:43–44.)\nHe believes implicitly the Lord’s promise that “it shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am.” (D&C 93:1.)\nHe joins with Job in declaring, “I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.” (Job 19:25–26.)\nHe joins with Alma in his wish:\n“O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth, and cry repentance unto every people!\n“Yea, I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of thunder, repentance and the plan of redemption, that they should repent and come unto our God, that there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth.” (Alma 29:1–2.)\nAnd finally, with Nephi he resolves:\n“I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.” (1 Ne. 3:7.)\nI add my personal testimony that I know that I am a son of God, and that you, my beloved listeners, are individually a son or a daughter of God, and that this knowledge implemented in our lives will lift us back into his presence through the atoning sacrifice of our Savior, Jesus Christ; and in his name I leave you this witness, even so. Amen."

        "content": "My brothers, sisters, friends, and all who are listening to the messages of this conference via radio and television: It is always difficult to follow President Romney because there is much meat in the talks and sermons he gives.\nToday many people of the world are questioning their belief in God, thinking they have progressed intellectually and scientifically beyond their need for his guidance in the affairs of life. They choose to forget that he is the source of all knowledge, he controls all life, and all things are his works of creation.\nMan cannot afford to forsake God, depending solely upon his own intelligence. Such a course can only lead to utter confusion and ultimate destruction. Not knowing the mind, will, and purpose of an infinite God, man does not have, regardless of his advanced knowledge, the wisdom and judgment, nor the correct answers to solve all world problems. With implicit faith we must all turn to the God of our fathers in humility and sincere prayer for counsel and guidance.\nThe prophet Isaiah admonished the children of Israel to “seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near:\n“Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.” (Isa. 55:6–7.)\nThis counsel is as important for us today as it was in those ancient times. Worsening, frustrating world problems, aggravated by a general departure from true Christian teachings and ethical practices, give warning of impending dangers and much sorrow unless man forsakes sin and turns to God in sincere repentance. Only by avoiding the pitfalls of evil and following Isaiah’s counsel can we expect to receive God’s mercy and his abundant pardon.\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ is the only sure basis for a righteous life. No other plan, moral code, or creed can match or supplant its teachings. The gospel is a wise and guiding set of laws, principles, and ordinances for all men to live by.\nThe weakness and foolishness of many today cause them to be more interested in the teachings of man than in the teachings of God, as found in both ancient and modern scriptures. Unfortunately, for the most part, the thoughts of mortal men are centered in this temporal life and not on the eternal life. The philosophies of men cannot replace nor transcend gospel philosophy as given in the revelations of God, nor can the science of man replace the truths revealed by God through his prophets.\nGod’s ways are not man’s ways, but are infinitely superior thereto. The Lord proclaimed to the prophet Isaiah:\n“For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, …\n“For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.” (Isa. 55:8–9.)\nBy revelation the Savior has furnished the following formula to guide our path to eternal glory:\n“Verily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am;\n“And that I am the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world.” (D&C 93:1–2.)\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches the complete way of life. Our whole life requires that we reach constantly for high ideals and noble standards of true Christian conduct. The faith of Latter-day Saints should not depend upon the wisdom of men, but upon the knowledge and power of God.\n“Be not deceived,” warned the apostle Paul; “God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.\n“For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.” (Gal. 6:7–8.)\nSeek learning by faith and earnest prayer to know the mind and will of the Lord. Have the courage to obey. Remember, the Lord gives no commandment or law unto the children of men that he himself does not obey. Obedience is a loving principle of a just God, and through obedience we can gain power from on high.\nIn this mortal life we not only have the opportunity, but the moral obligation, to right our wrongs. We should repent of our evil doings and confess them in order to give our lives spiritual direction. We are counseled to have faith in our Eternal Father and in his Son, our Redeemer. We should seek the desire, through righteous living, to once again dwell with them in the heavenly mansions they have prepared for the faithful. The following scripture sustains this thought:\n“For if you will that I give unto you a place in the celestial world, you must prepare yourselves by doing the things which I have commanded you and required of you.” (D&C 78:7.)\nIt is unfortunate that so many have to learn the lessons of life the hard way, but what a great blessing it is to have an Eternal Father who cares enough to teach us, to bring us to repentance, and to forgive. Hear the words of encouragement as given to the prophet Ezekiel: “Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord God: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?” (Ezek. 18:23.)\nThe Lord expressed to Moses great concern for the welfare of his children when he said: “… behold, this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.” (Moses 1:39.)\nImmortality is assured to all of us through the atonement of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. But eternal life is a personal responsibility we must earn and be worthy of.\nDavid the Psalmist emphasized the importance of man in this inspired statement:\n“What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?\n“For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.\n“Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet.” (Ps. 8:4–6.)\nMan’s recent scientific and technological accomplishments, his desire and courage to explore the universe, and his attainment in so many fields of learning testify he is a child of God and, therefore, should always look to God for guidance and further light and truth.\nGod has revealed that he desires all of his people to grow together in the unity of faith, understanding, and devotion. The apostle Paul so encouraged the Corinthian saints: “Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.” (1 Cor. 1:10.)\nWe are here to help each other progress, to inspire one another unto love and good works, and not just to sit in judgment. Our responsibility is to give encouragement to those who are inactive and erring. We have a duty to “see that there is no iniquity in the Church, neither hardness with each other, neither lying, backbiting, nor evil speaking.” (D&C 20:54.)\nThis teaching was emphasized by the apostle Peter when he gave this advice:\n“… be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:\n“Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.” (1 Pet. 3:8–9.)\nThe real strength of the Church is in the character and dedication of its members. The apostle Paul instructed the Corinthians: “Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.” (1 Cor. 9:14.) This counsel can be applied to every member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints—that by living the gospel and setting a good example we are automatically preaching its tenets and showing the right way for others to follow. The greatest gift we can give another is the gift of a good example.\nPresident Spencer W. Kimball said: “Our challenge today is to be a light unto the world. … if the three million members of the Church would live the gospel principles, all the errors of the world would evaporate. The world would come to us, and we would change the frustration of the world to the peace of the gospel.” ( February 26, 1972, p. 13.)\nI plead with all members of the Church to actively and honestly live the gospel of Christ. Our eternal happiness and joy depends upon the kind of life we chart and live here in mortality. The apostle Paul taught: “Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of devils.” (1 Cor. 10:21.) In other words, we cannot serve two masters, for either we will hate the one and love the other, or else we will hold to the one and despise the other. We cannot serve both God and mammon. (See Matt. 6:24.)\nAnyone who thinks he can obtain eternal goals some other way than outlined in the gospel of Christ should remember the Savior classified such as a thief and robber. (See John 10:1.) Christ gave this parable to his disciples:\n“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:\n“Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.” (Matt. 13:45–46.)\nEach of us has the responsibility to seek that goodly pearl, the kingdom of heaven, which is, according to the Savior’s parable, the pearl of great price. Its attainment is worth every effort and sacrifice we make. To be saved in the kingdom of God is the greatest of all the gifts of God, for there is no gift greater than the gift of salvation, and he that hath eternal life, proclaims the Lord, is rich. (See D&C 6:13, 7.)\nTo those members who are not living the gospel, I challenge you to do so, obeying all gospel requirements and attending church regularly for a full year. Then compare your life after a year’s trial of faithful gospel living with your previous manner of living, and ask yourself conscientiously which way is best. Give the gospel a chance in your life by living it, to prove its worth and value to you and to your family.\nLive to be worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost. If you have its spiritual influence, it will bring conviction into your hearts. It will build testimony and create in you a desire to love the Lord. You will manifest that love by keeping his laws and commandments and serving him. The Holy Spirit will testify to the truth of these teachings and you will know, as the apostle Paul knew, that the gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of God unto salvation. (See Rom. 1:16.)\nIt will also give you the perfect assurance that the Lord’s way is the only way one can find the abundant life the Savior promised.\nI extend this challenge to all people everywhere who desire to know the truth and who are not satisfied with their present lives and associations. It takes courage to accept the challenge to seek the Lord while he may be found and call upon him while he is near; but I promise you, if you do so, it will pay off in dividends of peace of mind, joy of heart, comfort of soul, satisfaction of personal needs, and a love that never fails.\nNow, brothers, sisters, and friends, I know that God lives. I know that Jesus is the Christ, our Redeemer and Savior, the very Son of God. He sacrificed his own life upon the cross that we might live eternally. He broke the bonds of death through his resurrection, which guarantees the resurrection of all mankind. He bought us with the price of his own blood. We can show our gratitude by living righteously and setting a proper example to all people everywhere.\nMay God bless and guide us aright; may we be blessed with the spiritual strength to close the door to all temptations of evil and walk uprightly before the Lord, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "My brothers and sisters: I appreciate very much this privilege of having some part with you in these great general conferences of the Church. This is the place where we come each six months to be instructed in our duties and built up in our faith. This is where some of the most important business of the Church is transacted. And then twice each year we have this thrilling, exciting experience of holding up our hands and making a personal covenant with the Lord that we will sustain and support those who are placed in authority over us in the Church and that we will also keep all of the Lord’s commandments.\nThe other evening I reread Saint Paul’s famous twelfth chapter of First Corinthians, in which he compared the various parts of the human body with the spiritual gifts and ecclesiastical offices which have been placed in the Church. He said that all were necessary and that the eye could not say to the hand, “I have no need of thee.” And each six months, as I see the thousands of raised hands in this assembly, I like to think of the great power and many important duties, both symbolic and otherwise, that we hold in our hands.\nThe Lord has placed in our hands the responsibility for working out our eternal exaltation in fear and trembling before him. When we are sick we have hands placed upon our heads and we are given a blessing for the restoration of our health. By the laying on of hands we confirm people members of the Church. We confer the Holy Ghost. We ordain people to the priesthood, and we set them apart for that portion of the work of the Lord that they are called to perform. We raise our hands in salute. We hold them over our hearts as we take our pledge of allegiance to the flag. We clasp hands in friendship and fellowship. We lay them upon the shoulders of our friends to give commendation and encouragement. With a pair of willing, ambitious, capable, clean hands, we can move mountains and we can save souls.\nIt was probably one of the greatest good fortunes of our lives when creation decided to flatten out the ends of both of our arms and place a hand on each one. When you put on your shirt in the morning, just imagine how you would get along if you had any other device except a hand on the end of your arm. Just suppose that you had a hoof or a claw or a wing, or a pair of pliers.\nThe story is told of a young man who went blind in his early youth. Many years later after an operation, the first thing that his newly restored vision rested upon was his own hand, and he thought he had never imagined anything quite so wonderful as his own hand with its circulation system, its communication system, its temperature control, its self-healing ability, and its wonderful covering of skin.\nOr think of the usefulness of these wonderful little bony levers that we call fingers. They can readily be trained to play the piano, dial telephone numbers, and do the accounting. Someone once said that a man’s best friends are his fingers. He said, “About the only thing that a man can really count on these days are his fingers.”\nI would like to remind you of an assignment that the Lord once gave to the fingers of the Israelites when he instituted this ancient custom of wearing phylacteries. The Lord knew then what every one of us ought to know now, that there are certain passages in the scriptures that must never be forgotten if our lives are to be successful. Therefore, to help the people to remember, he required that they write some of these passages down on pieces of parchment, encase them in little leather tubes, and bind them across their foreheads and between their eyes. They were required to hang them around their necks and bind them on their arms like wrist watches and wear them like rings upon their fingers. About this custom the Lord said to the people: “And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart:\n“And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.\n“And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.” (Deut. 6:6–8.)\nYou will recall that your mother used to make an interesting adaptation of this idea. When she sent you on an important errand, the purpose of which she did not want you to forget, she helped you to remember by tying a red string on your finger with a bow on the top so that no matter where you went or what you did, you would always remember what your mother wanted you to do. And that is about what the Lord did to the children of Israel.\nWhen I raise up my hand to make my personal covenant with the Lord, I try to imagine which phylacteries he would most like to see on my hand, and here are some of the things that I have been thinking about.\nThe first finger on the hand is the thumb. The thumb serves as the anchor man of the hand. And the first law of any success says that “you must know your business.” Lord Bacon said, “Knowledge is power.” Jesus said, “… this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” (John 17:3.)\nDr. Henry C. Link once pointed out that “nothing puts so much order into human life as to live by a set of sound principles.” And the most sound principles are the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. However, before we can live by them very effectively, we must know what they are.\nThe first question that Adam and Eve were asked to decide when they were placed in the Garden of Eden was whether or not they would eat the fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. And after they had eaten, God said, “… the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil.” (Gen. 3:22.)\nI would just like to point out in passing that the right kind of knowledge still tends to have that effect upon people. It still tends to make men and women become as God. A flaming sword was placed in the Garden of Eden to guard the tree of life, but fortunately for us there is no flaming sword guarding the tree of knowledge, and each one of us may eat to his heart’s content. And maybe you can think of something more exciting than that, but I don’t know what it would be. In this great age of restoration and enlightenment we can know about as much as we want to know about any subject, including God and his program for our eternal exaltation.\nThe second finger is the pointing finger. This is the finger you use to show people the way. This is the directing finger. And the second law of success says that you must be a convert before you can be a disciple. You must be a convert before you can be a leader. You must be a convert before you can show other people the way.\nJesus said to Peter, “Simon, … when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.” (Luke 22:31–32.) Peter may have been a little bit offended at this, as he probably felt that as the chief apostle, he was already converted; but what happened that very night at the house of Caiaphas when he denied the Lord three times may have indicated that even Peter was not fully converted. And it would help us if we made up a great credenda of beliefs and had strong, well-worked-out convictions centered in each one.\nThe third finger is the big finger. This is the power finger. It has the best location on the hand. The third law of success says that you must WANT to succeed—in capital letters. If I want to succeed in letters an inch high, I will fail. But if I want to succeed in letters a yard high, then I will succeed.\nThe Lord said, “… if ye have desires to serve God ye are called to the work.” (D&C 4:3.) If we don’t WANT to do it we can’t do it. Alma said that God grants unto every man according to his desires. (See Alma 29:4.) And we ought to spend a lot more time than we ordinarily do in increasing the volume and intensity of our righteous desires.\nA young man once came to Socrates and said, “Mr. Socrates, I have come sixteen hundred miles to talk to you about wisdom and learning.” He said, “You are a man of wisdom and learning and I would like to be a man of wisdom and learning. Would you teach me how to be a man of wisdom and learning?”\nSocrates said, “Come, follow me.” And he led the way down to the seashore.\nThen they waded out into the water up to their waists. Then Socrates seized his friend and held his head under the water. His friend struggled and kicked and bucked and tried to get away but Socrates held him down. Now if you hold somebody’s head under the water long enough he will eventually become fairly peaceable, and when this man had quit kicking, Socrates carried him out on the bank and laid him out to dry, and he went back to the marketplace.\nAfter this man had thawed out a little bit he came back to Socrates to find the reason for this rather unusual behavior, and Socrates said to him, “When your head was under the water, what was the one thing you wanted more than anything else?”\nAnd he said, “More than anything else I wanted air.”\nThen Socrates said, “When you want wisdom and learning like you wanted air, you won’t need to ask anybody to give it to you.”\nWhen we really WANT to be disciples of Christ, in capital letters, when we really WANT to be servants of the Master, then everything else will be easy. Someone once said to Mozart, “Would you teach me how to write symphonies?” Mozart said, “You are too young to write symphonies.” The young man said, “But you were fifteen years younger than I am when you began writing symphonies.” Mozart said, “But I didn’t have to ask anybody to teach me.” Only when we get some of these great qualities inside of ourselves are we in a position to make progress.\nNow the fourth finger is the ring finger. This is the finger that you use to fall in love with. This is the finger you get married with. This is the family finger. This is where you wear your family home evening phylactery. This is the finger that represents the source of most of your education and your satisfactions and your eternal happiness for both here and hereafter.\nShakespeare said, “No profit comes where there is no pleasure taken.” You can’t do very well that which you don’t enjoy doing. If we don’t get great pleasure out of our families, we should repent, because we are doing something wrong. If the work of the Lord seems burdensome and makes us weary, or if we don’t get exhilaration and uplift out of that part of the work of the world that life has given us to do, then we should repent. We need some more powerful satisfactions from life.\nNow the last finger is the little finger. This is the weakest finger. This is the finger that has the poorest position on the hand, and we might imagine that we could just take him off the team and throw him away without losing very much. However, the big finger cannot say to the little finger, “I have no need of thee.” The little finger may come at the end of the line-up, but that is the quarterback position, and you don’t need a great big man to be the quarterback, providing the other members of the team are fully qualified and effectively functioning. That is, the thumb knows his business backwards and forwards and upside down and standing on his head. The pointing finger has some powerful, well-developed convictions about it; the big finger WANTS to do it, in capital letters; the ring finger gets great satisfaction from doing it; and all the little finger has to do is to do it. He is the worker. He is the one who takes care of the mechanics of production. He is the one that handles the checkup and does the follow-through. He is the one Jesus came calling for when he pleaded for “doers of the word” and not just hearers and talkers only.\nSomeone has said, “My, oh my, what miracles we could accomplish if our hands moved as fast as our tongues.” He said, “After all is said and done, there is usually a lot more said than done.”\nAs I sit here on this platform each conference and raise up my hand to make my personal covenant with the Lord, it is stimulating to me to remember that the President of the Church sits directly behind me and God is over my head, and I would not like to have either of them feel that my hand was not clean or that any of my necessary phylacteries were missing. And if I had the gift of speech and the power to plant a conviction that I would like to have, I would say to the millions of people in the world who are earnestly seeking to be disciples of the Master to hold up their hands to God and make a solemn covenant with him to keep all of his commandments.\nAnd I would remind everyone of that thrilling occasion when Moses was leading the children of Israel in their battle against the Amalekites. Moses took the rod of God in his hands and went to the top of a sacred mount, where he held up his hands to God over the battle; and as long as Moses held up his hands, Israel prevailed. But when he let his hands down, the Amalekites prevailed. And as Moses’ arms became heavy with weariness, Aaron and Hur stood on either side of Moses and helped him to hold up his hands until the battle was won. (See Ex. 17:8–12.)\nIf we all hold up clean, honest, industrious hands to God, then his work will prevail. And then it will not be long before the prayer of the Master is fulfilled wherein he said to his Father, “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” (Matt. 6:10.) And may God bless you, my brothers and sisters, that all of us together may effectively hold up our hands to God and that our covenants may be acceptable to him. For this I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "Enoch, the sixth from Adam, was most certainly one of the great prophets of all time, for he walked and talked with the Lord for three hundred years, according to the scriptures. Imagine the understanding that entered his mind, the enlargement of his soul, and the eternal truths that were revealed to him by the Creator of the earth and the heavens.\nIn the Book of Moses in the Pearl of Great Price, we read:\n“And I saw the Lord; and he stood before my face, and he talked with me, even as a man talketh one with another, face to face; and he said unto me: Look, and I will show unto thee the world for the space of many generations.” (Moses 7:4.)\nThe Lord showed unto Enoch all the inhabitants of the earth, and he told him all the doings of the children of men. He saw the wickedness of the people, the flood which covered the earth in the days of Noah. He saw the day of the coming of the Son of Man in the flesh in the meridian of time; he beheld him lifted upon the cross; he saw the mourning of the creations of God and heard the earth groan; and in answer to Enoch’s inquiry and pleading, the Lord said to Enoch:\n“As I live, even so will I come in the last days, in the days of wickedness and vengeance. … the day shall come that the earth shall rest, but before that day the heavens shall be darkened, and a veil of darkness shall cover the earth; and the heavens shall shake, and also the earth; and great tribulations shall be among the children of men, but my people will I preserve.” (Moses 7:60–61.)\nOur Father and his Beloved Son knew before man was placed upon the earth, and before this world was created, the story of man’s existence upon this earth—the plan of life here and salvation and exaltation in the life to come. The dispensations of time were understood, the purpose of earth life was known, and the development of that plan was fully charted. Otherwise, how could the Lord show unto Enoch, as he did to other prophets also, the history of this world, including the families that should dwell upon the earth throughout the centuries of its existence?\nIn the Book of Abraham we read:\n“Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones;\n“And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born.” (Abr. 3:22–23.)\n\nIn the first chapter of the book of Jeremiah in the Bible, the Lord, in speaking to the prophet Jeremiah, said: “Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.” (Jer. 1:5.)\nNot only did the Lord know who were to be his rulers, but undoubtedly there was a chart or outline prepared showing the times of the various dispensations of the gospel, the things that would happen in those dispensations, and the conditions that would precede those periods of time.\nThe scriptures record the prophecies of God’s servants relative to these things. And from the time of Adam, the Lord through his prophets has foretold the events that would precede his second coming, the time when the gospel of our Lord should be restored to earth and proclaimed to all mankind.\nWhen King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon conquered Israel, he arranged to have brought to Babylon some of the princes of Israel; the record says: “Children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science. …” (Dan. 1:4.) Among these princes who were brought into Babylon was the Hebrew prophet, Daniel.\nIn the book of Daniel in the Bible, we read of a dream that Nebuchadnezzar had, which dream gave him great concern. The account says that upon awakening he was unable to recall the dream. He called upon the wise men of Babylon, the magicians, the sorcerers and Chaldeans, to tell him the dream and to give him the interpretation thereof. This, of course, was an unusual request, and these wise men were greatly agitated; they were unable to comply with the king’s demand.\nThe king had told them that if they did not make these things known to him, they would be destroyed. Daniel, recognizing the predicament, inquired of the Lord and was inspired by him to make known to Nebuchadnezzar the information he requested. He recalled to the king the dream and gave him the interpretation thereof.\nIn his dream Nebuchadnezzar had seen a great image like unto a man. The head of the image was of gold and represented the Babylonian kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar. The other various parts of the image represented the kingdoms that would follow. The account relates that, among other things, Daniel reminded the king: “Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.” (Dan. 2:34.) He further said that “in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed. …” (Dan. 2:44.)\nThe Lord knew in the days of Nebuchadnezzar the kingdoms that would come forth upon the earth. He knew the time when his kingdom, God’s kingdom, would be set up. He knew those choice souls, his prophets in this dispensation, Joseph Smith and those who have succeeded him. He knew and knows today the destiny of his church and kingdom, that it will roll forth and accomplish the purposes indicated in that remarkable dream.\nHow is it possible that in our day through his patriarchs and prophets the Lord can and does make known conditions pertaining to the future? How can they foretell that certain persons will be apostles and prophets in his church, even when such individuals are merely small children or young men at the time of the foretelling?\nAs an illustration, it was made known to Presidents Joseph F. Smith, Heber J. Grant, David O. McKay, and others that they would one day be in the leading councils of the Church, that they would be apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ, that they would become presidents of the Church in this dispensation. And to many others it has been made known that they would be appointed to positions of eminence, which predictions have been fulfilled.\n“… both Presidents Wilford Woodruff and Lorenzo Snow had prophesied that Joseph F. Smith [the father of President Joseph Fielding Smith] would sometime become president of the Church. Thirty-seven years earlier in the Hawaiian Islands when President Snow, then a member of the Council of Twelve, nearly lost his life by drowning, he declared that the Lord made known to him ‘that this young man, Joseph F. Smith … would some day be the Prophet of God on the earth.’ President Woodruff was once relating to a group of children some incidents in the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith. ‘He turned to Elder Joseph F. Smith and asked him to arise to his feet. Elder Smith complied. “Look at him, children,” Wilford Woodruff said, “… He will become the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I want everyone of you to remember what I have told you this morning.”’” (Joseph Fielding Smith, Jr., and John J Stewart, [Deseret Book Co., 1972], p. 124.)\nWhen Heber J. Grant, who became the seventh president of the Church, was a child playing on the floor in a Relief Society meeting, Eliza R. Snow, who was truly a prophetess, gave him a blessing in tongues, which was interpreted by Sister Zina Y. Card, to the effect that that little boy would someday be an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ.\nOn another occasion Heber C. Kimball, one of the counselors to President Brigham Young in the First Presidency of the Church, stood that same boy on a table and prophesied that someday he would be a greater man in the Church than his father, and his father, Jedediah M. Grant, was a counselor to President Brigham Young.\nAgain, when Brother Grant, at the age of 24 years, was president of the Tooele Stake, Patriarch John Rowberry gave him a patriarchal blessing in which he was told that he would someday be in the leading councils of the Church; and after the blessing was given, he told Brother Grant: “Heber, I dare not tell you what I saw when I had my hands upon your head.”\nBrother Grant later, after becoming president of the Church, said that when Brother Rowberry made that statement it went through his mind just as if a voice said it, “You will someday be the president of the Church.” Brother Grant thought it was such a presumption on his part to even think such a thought that he never mentioned it to anyone until after he did become president of the Church.\nOn one occasion, when President David O. McKay was in his youth serving as a missionary in the land of Scotland, a very spiritual missionary meeting was held under the direction of Elder James McMurrin, a counselor in the mission presidency. As testimonies were borne and spiritual experiences mentioned, President McMurrin turned to President McKay and said: “Elder McKay, I’ll say to you as the Savior said to Peter, ‘Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.’” He then said, “If you are faithful you will yet stand in the leading councils of the Church.”\nOther similar experiences could be related.\nAs was the case with Abraham and Jeremiah and others of the ancient prophets, these men, leaders of God’s kingdom in this dispensation, were chosen before they were born to represent him in this last dispensation.\nIt is interesting to read the history of the past wherein are related conditions leading up to the ushering in of this dispensation of the gospel: the work that was done by the reformers, Luther, Calvin, Knox, and others; the manner in which the way was opened for the printing of the Bible so that the people generally could have the privilege of reading God’s word; the miraculous development of the art of printing; how the spirit of freedom came into the hearts of people who wanted to worship God according to the dictates of their conscience; the coming of the Pilgrim fathers to this land in search of freedom and liberty; the war for independence; the establishment of the Constitution—all looking forward to the time and preparing the way for the restoration of the gospel, the opening of this dispensation.\nThe dispensation of the fulness of times was introduced upon the earth by the visit to the boy Joseph Smith of the Father and the Son and other heavenly beings. Darkness was dissipated and there came an outpouring of light and intelligence. The kingdom of God, as indicated in the dream of Nebuchadnezzar, has been established upon the earth and is rolling forth as the stone cut out of the mountain without hands, and it will continue to do so, looking forward to the time of the coming of the Lord.\nThrough his experience and his omniscience, our Heavenly Father knows the end from the beginning. Through his prophets he has revealed and does reveal the history of mankind, the timetable of life upon this planet.\nThis is the dispensation of the fulness of times, when the keys of all former dispensations have been given to the prophets of the restoration, a time when God has spoken from the heavens and angels have appeared to man, a time when men and women have the Holy Ghost conferred upon them, and by the power of the Holy Ghost we may know the truth of all things. There is need for this great power in the earth today.\nThe history of this world is in fulfillment of the plan prepared in the heavens before this earth was created. That which the world calls Mormonism is based upon the rock of revelation. It is the gospel of Jesus Christ, the eternal truth, the plan of life and salvation. I testify to these things in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "Brothers and sisters and friends: Much has already been said in this conference about the powerful influence for good that the family and home training have been and will be upon the rising generation. For the past three months President Harold B. Lee has been speaking through film the great story It is going to many people in many lands and in many languages.\nIt seems that while the world accepts the spurious and the vulgar and the errors, there is an increasing number of wise leaders who write and speak of the importance of the family and home life.\nOne such leader wrote: “… strong family life is indispensable, not merely to the culture but actually the survival of any people.” (Paul Popenoe, September 1972.)\nHe continues: “In the history of mankind one nation after another has followed this pattern [of degrading the family life and substituting other patterns for it] and they have disappeared.”\nThe family provides the involvement in selfless activities and the acceptance of responsibility. He says, again:\n“… for the well being of the community; for the very existence of the nation, one of the first questions asked about any proposed change in the culture should be, ‘Will it strengthen the family?’”\nThe Lord organized the whole program in the beginning with a father who procreates, provides, and loves and directs, and a mother who conceives and bears and nurtures and feeds and trains. The Lord could have organized it otherwise but chose to have a unit with responsibility and purposeful associations where children train and discipline each other and come to love, honor, and appreciate each other. The family is the great plan of life as conceived and organized by our Father in heaven.\nTo any thoughtful person it must be obvious that intimate association without marriage is sin; that children without parenthood and family life is tragedy; that society without basic family life is without foundation and will disintegrate into nothingness and oblivion.\nThe Father knew all this when he gave this command to his children in November 1831. He was not arguing that there should be families. He seemed to take that for granted and commanded: “… as parents have children in Zion … they shall also teach their children to pray and to walk uprightly before the Lord.” (D&C 68:25, 28.)\nWe see the blessings of family life as we make contrasts. In the address above referred to, President Lee gave these figures:\n“Of 180,000 divorces recorded by the Census Bureau … 57 percent were in homes where there were no children; 21.2 percent where there was only one child; and in families with five or more children, divorces were less than one percent.”\nThis is a telling story.\nOnce when I talked to leaders in a foreign world where different ideologies touch their children, I asked how the parents were able to hold their children and keep them from the evil, and their reply was so natural and so proper:\n“We train our children in our homes so completely in the way of right and truth that the destructive, godless philosophies and heresies of their other teachers run off without penetrating, like water on a duck’s back, and our children remain true to the faith.”\nAh, that is the answer. Family life, home life, home evenings, dedicated, selfless parents. That is the way the Lord ordained our lives to be.\nMore than a decade ago a major in the U.S. Air Force told of his test flights. He was born of goodly parents who taught him righteousness. He had flown 25 different types of military aircraft in 4,000 hours in the air. He had flown 142 combat missions in Korea and had received many distinguished medals. He told us that “before takeoff every pilot takes a few moments to make a last-minute check of his engine, flight controls, hydraulic and pneumatic systems and other essential subsystems of his aircraft to be sure the flight can at least begin safely. … His reactions to emergency conditions must be instinctive and as infallible as human thought and reflexes permit.\n“… Yet, there is something missing on the printed checklist which to me has become as necessary to a successful flight as lowering the wheels for a smooth landing. It is a prayer to ask my Father in heaven to bless me that my best judgment and skill will guide my actions, especially in periods of stress. There have been several instances … in which I know the answer to this prayer has been received with dramatic suddenness. …”\nBeing born of goodly parents in a goodly home with goodly training in his infancy, childhood, and youth, he seemed to feel secure in his hazardous work.\nThis major was unafraid, for he was prepared. He knew the power of the Lord’s statement: “If ye are prepared, ye shall not fear.” (D&C 38:30.)\nSomeone said that “fear and fortitude are opposites but both are necessary for the growth of character. … wholesome fear generates its own antibodies.”\nThese three lines were lettered on the mantel in an English hotel at the time of Dunkirk, a time when every man or boy who could navigate, no matter how amateurishly, found a hero in himself brave enough to help rescue England’s army:\n\n“Fear knocked at the door.\nFaith answered.\nNo one was there.”\n\nDuring the blitzkrieg, many a man saw a sign down by the London docks and followed its suggestion: “If your knees are knocking, kneel on them.”\nAgain, the revelation says, “If ye are prepared ye shall not fear.”\nThat preparation comes from infancy and childhood training, when faith is born and character established. It is a bit late to try to build faith when the ship is sinking or the plane is falling or the head-on collision is certain.\nOne air navigator gave us this: “I had said my prayer back in the fifteenth orbit”; and another: “Courage is said to be fear that has said its prayers.”\nIf children are tuned in on the right wave length, if they are taught early the responsibilities of time and eternities, they will usually react properly when engulfed in emergencies. If they have conscientiously and faithfully done all that is expected of them, nothing can be too far wrong. The Nephite prophet insisted: “… ye pour out your souls in your closets, and your secret places; and in your wilderness.” (Alma 34:26.)\nAnd what a great legacy to our children Isaiah promised: “And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord and great shall be the peace of thy children.” (Isa. 54:13.)\nSurely every good parent would like this peace for his offspring. It comes from the simple life of the true Latter-day Saint as he makes his home and family supreme.\n“Pray in your families unto the Father, always in my name, that your wives and your children may be blessed.” (3 Ne. 18:21.)\nIs that too much to ask?\nI was in Idaho Falls and was the guest in a home of a typical Church family. There were a dedicated set of parents and many children. The oldest was in military duty in the dreaded South Pacific, and the hearts of the family followed him from place to place. They handed me his latest letter from the war zone. I read this:\n“There have been times when we were so scared, we would tremble, but the fear was out of our minds with prayer and the knowledge that we were being guided by the Lord.\n“Dad, I love my religion and I am proud that I had someone like you and Mother to teach me to pray. Then I also know that you are praying for me each morning and night. …”\nSpirituality is born in the home and is nurtured in the home evenings, in the twice-a-day and oftener daily prayers, in the weekly meetings when the family goes en masse. That spirituality as the foundation of one’s life comes to his rescue when emergency strikes.\nSecurity is not born of inexhaustible wealth but of unquenchable faith. And generally that kind of faith is born and nurtured in the home and in childhood.\nPrayer is the passport to spiritual power.\nFrom World War II comes a story of a young Utah boy who was called to serve his country in the faraway places across several time zones.\nOn his wrist he wore the conventional wristband watch to tell him the time in the area in which he was living. But strangely enough, he carried a larger, old-time heavier watch in his pocket, which gave another time of day. His buddies noted that frequently he would look at his wrist watch, then turn to the old-fashioned one in his pocket, and this led them, in their curiosity, to ask him why the additional watch. Unembarrassed, he promptly said:\n“The wristwatch tells me the time here where we are, but the big watch which Pa gave me tells me what time it is in UTAH. You see,” he continued, “mine is a large family—a very close family. When the big watch says 5 a.m. I know Dad is rolling out to milk the cows. And any night when it says 7:30, I know the whole family is around a well-spread table on their knees thanking the Lord for what’s on the table and asking Him to watch over me and keep me clean and honorable. It’s those things that make me want to fight when the goin’ gets tough. … I can find out what time it is here easy enough. What I want to know is what time it is in UTAH.” (Adapted from Vaughn R. Kimball, “The Right Time at Home,” May 1944, p. 43.)\nI knew this family well. I knew the sailor slightly. I knew this father. His cows had to feed a large family, but his greater interest was the growing children who needed more than milk and bread. I have knelt in mighty prayer with this wonderful family. The home training has carried through to the eternal blessing of this large family.\nO my beloved hearers, what a world it would be if a million families in this church were to be on their knees like this every night and morning! And what a world it would be if nearly a hundred million families in this great land and other hundreds in other lands were praying for their sons and daughters twice daily. And what a world this would be if a billion families through the world were in home evenings and church activity and were on their physical knees pouring out their souls for their children, their families, their leaders, their governments!\nThis kind of family life could bring us back toward the translation experience of righteous Enoch. The millennium would be ushered in. Enoch was asked questions about himself; he answered, among other things, “… my father taught me in all the ways of God.” (Moses 6:41.) And Enoch walked with God and he was not, for God took him.\nEnoch and his people dwelt in righteousness in the City of Holiness, even Zion. And Zion was taken up into heaven.\nYes, here is the answer: righteous, teaching parents; obedient, loving children; faithfulness to family duties.\nThese qualities in a home make for security and character in the lives of children.\nThe following verses of Ethel Lynn Beers, written more than a century ago, emphasize unity of the family and real parental love.\nA childless man of wealth offers ease and security in exchange for one of seven children. Which shall it be?\n\n“Which shall it be? Which shall it be?\nI looked at John, John looked at me,\nAnd when I found that I must speak,\nMy voice seemed strangely low and weak:\n‘Tell me again what Robert said,’\nAnd then I, listening, bent my head.\nThis is his letter:\n‘I will give\nA house and land while you shall live,\nIf, in return, from out your seven,\nOne child to me for aye is given.’\n\n“I looked at John’s old garments worn;\nI thought of all that he had borne\nOf poverty, and work, and care,\nWhich I, though willing, could not share;\nI thought of seven young mouths to feed,\nOf seven little children’s need,\nAnd then of this.\n\n“‘Come, John,’ said I,\n‘We’ll choose among them as they lie\nAsleep.’ So, walking hand in hand,\nDear John and I surveyed our band:\nFirst to the cradle lightly stepped,\nWhere Lilian, the baby, slept.\nSoftly the father stooped to lay\nHis rough hand down in a loving way,\nWhen dream or whisper made her stir,\nAnd huskily he said: ‘Not her!’\n\n“We stooped beside the trundle bed,\nAnd one long ray of twilight shed\nAthwart the boyish faces there,\nIn sleep so beautiful and fair;\nI saw on James’s rough, red cheek\nA tear undried. E’er John could speak,\n‘He’s but a baby, too,’ said I,\nAnd kissed him as we hurried by.\n\n“Pale, patient, Robbie’s angel face\nStill in his sleep bore suffering’s trace.\n‘No, for a thousand crowns, not him!’\nHe whispered, while our eyes were dim.\n\n“Poor Dick! bad Dick! our wayward son—\nTurbulent, restless, idle one—\nCould he be spared? Nay, He who gave\nBade us befriend him to the grave;\nOnly a mother’s heart could be\nPatient enough for such as he;\n‘And so,’ said John, ‘I would not dare\nTo take him from her bedside prayer.’\n\n“Then stole we softly up above,\nAnd knelt by Mary, child of love;\n‘Perhaps for her ’twould better be,’\nI said to John. Quite silently\nHe lifted up a curl that lay\nAcross her cheek in a wilful way,\nAnd shook his head: ‘Nay, love, not thee,’\nThe while my heart beat audibly.\n\n“Only one more, our eldest lad,\nTrusty and truthful, good and glad,\nSo like his father. ‘No, John, no!\nI cannot, will not, let him go.’\n\n“And so we wrote, in courteous way,\nWe could not give one child away;\nAnd afterward toil lighter seemed,\nThinking of that of which we dreamed,\nHappy in truth that not one face\nWas missed from its accustomed place;\nThankful to work for all the seven,\nTrusting the rest to One in heaven.”\n\nMay we in the Church and in this world come to know the Lord’s ways and follow them explicitly, I pray.\nI add my solemn witness that President Harold B. Lee is the Lord’s divinely called prophet to this world. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "When the Savior established his church during his mortal ministry, and as it was further developed by the twelve apostles of that day, one important fact became conspicuously clear, which is: that salvation comes through the Church.\nIt does not come through any separate organization or splinter group nor to any private party as an individual. It comes only through the Church itself as the Lord established it.\nIt was the Church that was organized for the perfecting of the Saints.\nIt was the Church that was given for the work of the ministry.\nIt was the Church that was provided to edify the body of Christ, as Paul explained to the Ephesians.\nTherefore it was made clearly manifest that salvation is in the Church, and of the Church, and is obtained only through the Church.\nThe Lord established one strait and narrow way, and understandingly observed that “few there be that find it.”\nNot only did he provide that salvation should come through his regularly constituted church, but he set up safeguards to protect its members from being tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine and to preserve them from the sleight of men who, with cunning craftiness, lie in wait to deceive. (See Eph. 4:14.)\nThose safeguards, according to Paul’s epistle to the Ephesians, rested primarily in the persons of the apostles and prophets whom God placed at the head of the Church for that specific purpose.\nThey were the inspired leaders in the Church. They were the mouthpieces of the Lord, and their inspired messages to the people were the will of the Lord, the mind of the Lord, the voice of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation. (See D&C 68:4.)\nWith such heavenly guidance, none need go astray.\nBut there were men in the Lord’s own day who taught false doctrines and led the people into mistaken paths. These the Savior severely criticized, accusing them of apostasy from the very law of Moses which they pretended to preach.\nHe said to them, “Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law?” (John 7:19.)\nAnd again he said, “… had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.” (John 5:46.)\nWhat a sad commentary! Had the people believed Moses, instead of the crafty false teachers of their day, they would have accepted Christ, because Moses wrote of Christ. And if they had accepted Jesus, they would have received salvation through his church.\nBut being blinded by false teachers, they rejected both Moses and Christ, and thus never joined the Lord’s church and hence did not receive the salvation which was available through it.\nObviously all of the writings of Moses are not in our Bibles of today, but in the Savior’s time they must have been available, for Jesus criticized the elders and scribes for not believing what Moses said when he testified of Christ.\nIsn’t it interesting that Moses testified of the Savior, and that when the people would not believe Moses they therefore were not prepared to receive the Christ either? Do you recall that Paul said the law of Moses was a schoolmaster to bring the people to Christ? (See Gal. 3:24–25.)\nNot only did Moses write of the Lord, but the other prophets did likewise. Peter said, in speaking of Jesus, “To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.” (Acts 10:43.)\nWe read in the 28th chapter of Acts that Paul, while he was in Rome, received many visitors “to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.” (Acts 28:23.)\nObviously, therefore, the scriptures available in that time spoke repeatedly of the Savior as all the prophets gave witness to him.\nSo there was no excuse for those who led the people astray, persuading them to crucify the Lord, knowing full well that the scriptures spoke plainly of him.\nThese false teachers of New Testament times established cults of their own, separate and apart from the true work of God, and they, with their man-made traditions, formed the chief opposition to Jesus as he began his ministry.\nYou are familiar with the names of some of those cults. The Pharisees and the Sadducees are best known. Both were apostate in their teachings. Both were condemned by the Lord, and both developed the religious bigotry which eventually brought about the crucifixion.\nOthers of these cults included:\nThe Zadokites, who wanted a stricter observance of the Mosaic laws.\nThe Essenes, who are believed to have written the Dead Sea Scrolls. They rejected temple worship.\nThe Zealots, a religious anti-Roman cult.\nAmong the strongest were the Hellenists, who sought to impose Greek philosophy upon the people, trying to merge it with the Mosaic law. They also rejected temple worship.\nBut a new apostasy developed even during the Lord’s own ministry. As early as the events recorded in the sixth chapter of John, this falling away took place. You will recall from reading that chapter in the New Testament that many of his disciples would not accept his pure doctrine and therefore fell away and no longer followed him.\nIn apparent dismay, Jesus turned to the Twelve and asked, “Will ye also go away?”\nThen it was that Simon Peter replied, “Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.”\nNote if you will that the words of eternal life were not with those who fell away, but rather with those who remained faithful and loyal.\nSubsequently, during the administration of the Twelve, serious apostasy developed again. As a result, nearly all of the epistles of the New Testament were written to combat it.\nHistorians say that within one hundred years after Christ, as many as thirty splinter groups and separate denominations of Christians arose.\nFurther evidence of early apostasy in the Church is brought forcefully and particularly to our attention by the manner in which Paul wrote his first letter to the Corinthians.\nIn it he testified that there can be no divisions in Christ. Rather, he said, “… I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.” (1 Cor. 1:10.)\nSome of the denominations which developed during the very early years of Christianity were these:\nThe Judaeo-Christians, who tried to Judaize Christianity and force it to include the Mosaic rites.\nThe Millenarianists.\nThe Ebionites, who preserved the custom of using water in the sacrament instead of wine.\nThe Gnostics, who rejected Jehovah and the Mosaic law.\nThe Elkesaites, known as baptists.\nThe Archontics, who taught the existence of a supreme mother in heaven.\nThe Coptics, who are still extant in Egypt.\nThe Syriac Christians.\nThe Mandaeans, another baptist sect.\nThe Manecheans, and a number of others.\nAfter the fall of Jerusalem about a.d. 70, the Hellenists seized the upper hand in the Christian religion, taking advantage of the Greek influence, which was being superimposed on the existing culture of the area. Greek philosophical ideas entered strongly into the Christian picture, changing the doctrines and practices of the gospel. This will be understood more readily when it is remembered that both Arius and Athanasius of the Nicene Creed controversy were Greek philosophers. This also is why the early New Testament manuscripts were written in Greek.\nThese bits of history reveal clearly the importance of avoiding splinter groups, for as Paul expressed it, some “saith I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas” (1 Cor. 1:12), but Christ cannot be divided. There is no Savior but Jesus, and he saves only in his own strait and narrow way and not according to man-made creeds and rituals.\nIt is all important, then, that members should not separate themselves from the true church, nor apostatize from it, nor be guilty of behavior which would justify their excommunication.\nIf persons separate themselves from the Lord’s church, they thereby separate themselves from his means of salvation, for salvation is through the Church.\nSome modern people have created cults of their own, and among them are those who attempt to take refuge in section 85 of the Doctrine and Covenants.\nThey endeavor to say that the Church has gone astray, that the leaders are no longer inspired, and that “one mighty and strong” is needed to take over the affairs of the Lord. And without any evidence of modesty whatsoever on their parts, they themselves volunteer for the position.\nThere is one verse particularly in that section which they fail to consider. It is especially pertinent. It says that apostates and others who have been cut off from the Church will not be found among the Saints of the Most High at the last day. Why? Because salvation is in the Church, not elsewhere.\nListen to the Lord’s words:\n“And they who are of the High Priesthood, whose names are not found written in the book of the law, or that are found to have apostatized, or to have been cut off from the church, as well as the lesser priesthood, or the members, in that day shall not find an inheritance among the Saints of the Most High.” (D&C 85:11.)\nBut cultists are not the only ones who are excommunicated from the Church. There are those who are cut off for moral transgressions and other infractions of the Lord’s rules of behavior. They too should ponder this scripture most carefully.\nIf people believe in God at all, if they have any regard whatever for their own salvation, should they not realize, as is expressed in scripture, that salvation is through the Church, and that if people are cut off from the Church for any reason, they thus lose their inheritance in the kingdom of God?\nPresident Brigham Young was very expressive in describing the fate of apostates when he said:\n“Why do people apostatize? You know we are on the ‘Old Ship Zion.’ We are in the midst of the ocean. A storm comes on, and, as sailors say, she labors very hard. ‘I am not going to stay here,’ says one; ‘I don’t believe this is the “Ship Zion.”’ ‘But we are in the midst of the ocean.’ ‘I don’t care, I am not going to stay here.’ Off goes the coat, and he jumps overboard. Will he not be drowned? Yes. So with those who leave this Church. It is the ‘Old Ship Zion.’ Let us stay in it.”\nAnd then he added: “If the candle of the Almighty does not shine from this place, you need not seek for its light anywhere else.”\nAnd then this mighty man in Israel declared:\n“Whenever there is a disposition manifested in any of the members of the Church to question the right of the President of the whole Church to direct in all things, you see manifested evidences of apostasy—of a spirit which, if encouraged, will lead to a separation from the Church and to final destruction; wherever there is a disposition to operate against any legally appointed officer of this Kingdom, no matter in what capacity he is called to act, if persisted in, it will be followed by the same results.” So spoke President Brigham Young. ( [Deseret Book Co., 1943], pp. 82–83, 85.)\nThe language of the Lord is simple and easily understood. If any have apostatized from the Church or have been cut off by the duly appointed courts provided by the Lord, they shall not find an inheritance among the Saints of the Most High unless they repent.\nSalvation is not to be found in splinter groups today any more than it was to be found in the various denominations which polluted the teachings of Moses anciently or which, in the days of early Christianity, transgressed the laws, changed the ordinances, and broke the everlasting covenant.\nThe Lord says further in this same section of the Doctrine & Covenants: “… all they who are not found written in the book of remembrance shall find none inheritance in that day, but they shall be cut asunder, and their portion shall be appointed them among unbelievers, where are wailing and gnashing of teeth.” (D&C 85:9.)\nThere are some who claim that even though they are excommunicated from the Church, their priesthood and temple blessings are not taken away. Let us remind those persons that the power to seal is also the power to loose, for the Lord has said of his true servants that “whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.” (Matt. 16:19; D&C 132:46.) Excommunication takes away all rights, privileges, and blessings of the Church.\nWhat is so precious as salvation? And how is it to be obtained? Only through the Church and “being anxiously engaged” in its program.\nThere is no other way. If we are not valiant in the testimony of Jesus and if we fail to repent, we lose the crown over the kingdom and are assigned elsewhere. (See D&C 76:79.)\nBut how wonderful is repentance. The Lord has said that if we will repent of our sins and from then on keep all of his statutes, forgiveness will result and reformation is made possible.\nWhat greater promise can the wayward expect?\nThe Lord came to save sinners. He taught that it is the sick who need the physician. Therefore, he invites the sick—as well as all others—to come unto him, repent, and be cleansed, sanctified, and saved in his kingdom.\n“Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord God: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?” (Ezek. 18:23.)\nAnd so in his goodness and mercy, he calls out and says:\n“Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\n“Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\n“For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” (Matt. 11:28–30.)\nBut let us remember that his yoke cannot be separated from his church, and his burden requires that each one of us live by every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God. And to this I testify humbly in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "It is my purpose today to bear testimony to some who have special needs, and to those who have accepted commission from the Lord and covenanted with him to try to help satisfy those needs.\nAs Christ taught the gospel to the people of this hemisphere, he asked them, “… what manner of men ought ye to be?” and answered, “Verily I say unto you, even as I am.” (3 Ne. 27:27.)\nAs Christians, we accept that instruction reverently as our guide and our goal.\nWe know that Christ loves his Father. He came into the world to do the will of his Father, knowing the part he was to play, the price he would have to pay.\nHe loves us, and for us he fulfilled his mortal mission with suffering so intense and so deep as to cause him to bleed at every pore. With his blood he bought us, brought us the gift of immortality, and made possible for us all good and lovely things now and eternally.\nHe was gracious but he was not timid. He taught men the truth about his Father, the living God, and testified of him and of his own atoning mission, even though many who had followed him thereafter no longer walked with him. He cried repentance and was baptized of John in Jordan, and taught all men to do likewise, and promised the obedient and faithful the blessing of the Holy Ghost.\nChrist knows the worth of souls.\nHe came as Isaiah had prophesied and as he affirmed in the synagogue in Nazareth: “… to preach the gospel to the poor; … to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised.” (Luke 4:18.)\nHe taught the parables of the lost sheep and the lost coin and the lost son, and he lunched with accused Zacchaeus; admonished men to emulate the compassionate act of the demeaned Samaritan—“Go thou and do likewise.” He exalted the humble Publican, who, in contrast to the self-righteous Pharisee, “would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner” (Luke 18:13); and he confronted the accusers of the repentant woman.\nSo closely is he tied with his fellowmen that in one of the most powerful parables he taught that bread given to one of the least of his brethren is bread given to him, and so is any kindness or act of grace or mercy or service. To deny help to one of the least of his brethren, he said, was to deny him.\nHis message is one of hope and promise and peace to those who mourn the loss of loved ones: “And ye now therefore have sorrow; but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.” (John 16:22.)\nTo the lonely and the hopeless and those who are afraid, his reassurance reaches out: “I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.” (Heb. 13:5.)\nChrist understands. “Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.” (Heb. 2:17–18.) “For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.” (Heb. 4:15.)\nHe prayed to the Father for those who were not obedient, and he wept.\nHe called little children to him and blessed them, and wept.\nHe taught us to pray.\nThese and much more he taught and did. They represent the manner of person he was.\nOf course he was more: he was the Divine Redeemer, the Savior of all mankind, the Firstborn in the spirit and the Only Begotten in the flesh. He was the Prince of Peace. He “came into the world … to be crucified for the world, and to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse it from all unrighteousness; That through him all might be saved. …” (D&C 76:41–42.)\nWhat he did for us we could never do for ourselves, and his example of love and service and sacrifice and seeking first the kingdom of God is our guidestar and our path.\nWhat does he expect of us?\nAt his call, commissioned with his holy priesthood, being his agents, on his errand, we are under covenant to represent him faithfully and to do the will of the Father.\nAll about us are opportunities.\nThere came the other day the story of the small boy who had lost his pet and who in tears beseeched his anxious mother for help. She reminded him lovingly that she had tried as hard as she could to find the pet without success. “What more can I do, son?” she asked. “You can cry with me,” he said.\n“Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.” (Gal. 6:2.)\nA cherished friend who works with little children who have difficulties told me recently of a nine-year-old girl who has lived in 17 foster homes. She needs someone to cry with her, and laugh with her, and teach her, and love her.\nThere are so many who are not—or feel they are not—understood. Recently our family visited with a dear friend, Sister Louise Lake, who has lived her gracious, sharing life in a wheelchair for more than a quarter of a century.\nPerhaps because our 12-year-old son was with us, Sister Lake told us of another 12-year-old with whom she became acquainted in a rehabilitation center in New York where she was working. The boy had been blind and for most of his 12 years had lived a sad existence, thought to be uneducable, incapable of learning. Then he was given a chance, thank the Lord, and a marvelous spirit and fine mind were discovered. He told his friend that he had thought all his life that being blind was the worst thing that could happen to one—until he met Campy. Campy was Roy Campanella, great athlete, who at the height of his career was rendered physically helpless in an automobile accident. The blind boy said he had decided after meeting Campy that his condition was worse than not being able to see. “But there is something even worse than that,” he said. He talked of feeling his way down the hall at the hospital, hearing the scuff of feet as people passed him by. “There is something worse than being blind or crippled, and that is to have people not understand you,” he said. “I guess they think that because I am blind I can’t hear or speak either.”\nThere is one who always understands, and those who seek to become the manner of person he is must seek to understand. We are never really alone when we love God and accept the friendship of his loving Son. I think of the mother of 14 children who was asked if she had a favorite. “Well,” she said, “if I do, it’s the one who is ill until she gets well, or the one who is away until he gets home.” So it seems to be with the Lord.\nAfter a meeting with our servicemen at DaNang in South Vietnam, we talked with a senior pilot who had come very close to death that day and who was still shaken. He had a request to make, and he made it shyly, not wanting to impose. “I wonder if you might have just a minute when you get home, Brother Hanks, to call or write a note to my 12-year-old son to tell him that I am all right and that his dad is thinking about him. He was ordained a deacon last Sunday without his father there, and I want him to know how much I love him.”\nThose nearest us need love also.\nThere are so many who grieve and are weighted down because they have not behaved in a way their own conscience can approve. To them the Lord still speaks through his prophets ancient and modern. Recall the words of Jacob to his brethren: “And now my beloved brethren, seeing that our merciful God has given us so great knowledge concerning these things, let us remember him, and lay aside our sins, and not hang down our heads, for we are not cast off. …” (2 Ne. 10:20.)\nIn the last recorded letter of the great prophet Mormon to his son Moroni are written the lamentings of the prophet over the wickedness of the people, described in the record to be “without principle, and past feeling.” Mormon’s final testimony to his beloved son included this marvelous admonition and explanation of the effect Christ’s gifts should have in all of our lives: “My son, be faithful in Christ; and may not the things which I have written grieve thee, to weigh thee down unto death; but may Christ lift thee up, and may his sufferings and death [and his resurrection], … and his mercy and long-suffering, and the hope of his glory of eternal life, rest in your mind forever.” (Moro. 9:25.)\nChrist in our lives is not meant to grieve us or weigh us down unto death because we have been imperfect. Through him we may be lifted up by accepting his gifts and his mercy and long-suffering. These blessings we must seek to keep in our minds always. “For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?” (Mosiah 5:13.)\nThey who would follow him and be the manner of person he is will, as he did, lift up the repentant who suffer and sorrow for sin, and bless them with love and forgiveness.\nOf course, all honest men on occasion feel their weakness and groan in the face of their inadequacies and ignorance and pride. Even Job, that good and godly man who possessed a faith which all his afflictions could not shake, bore this witness at the conclusion of his ordeal, when, seeing God, he said, “I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee. I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.” (Job 42:2, 5–6.)\nBut Christ will lift us up and help us to become as he is as we do as he did; as we love our Father and give him our lives; as we love each other and all men, and learn to live and teach his word; believe in the worth of souls and let our lives be the warrant of our earnestness; mourn with those who mourn, and bring hope to them; understand and comfort those who weep; cry unto the Lord.\n“Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare, and also for the welfare of those who are around you.\n“And now behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, do not suppose that this is all; for after ye have done all these things, if ye turn away the needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and impart of your substance, if ye have, to those who stand in need—I say unto you, if ye do not any of these things, behold, your prayer is vain, and availeth you nothing, and ye are as hypocrites who do deny the faith.” (Alma 34:27–28.)\nGod bless us to look up and to look around and to kneel down, and to be worthy, and to become the manner of person he is, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "year": 1973,
        "content": "When I decided to choose a subject for this moment, I discovered I did not have enough words in the English language to properly express my true feelings, but it is the only language I know and so I shall have to use them and hope that the prayer of Brother Burton, which he offered at the beginning, will be applied to me as well as to you.\nIt is my purpose to speak of the Lord Jesus Christ.\nFrom the depths of my soul I know that he has established the Church in these last days so that I may partake of the blessings of his kingdom on earth, to the end that I may inherit the eternal joy of dwelling in his presence when I have completed my work here, if I can prove faithful. He did not intend this to be my privilege alone. In his infinite love he reaches out to all of my family, all of my kin, to all of your families and kin, and to all of the people on the earth.\nI know that I cannot know him as he is unless he reveals himself to me. That is the great hope—to penetrate the veil and see and know him as he is. Yet I do know some things because he has told holy men, who are prophets, about himself and has commanded that they bear record of what they saw and heard. I know that by reading about him in the scriptures I can hear his voice by the power of the Holy Ghost; that is, to read his word is to hear his voice.\nSpeaking through the Prophet Joseph Smith to his future modern apostles, he said: “These words are not of men nor of man, but of me; … For it is my voice which speaketh them unto you; for they are given by my Spirit unto you, and by my power you can read them one to another. … [Notice he said read them.] Wherefore, you can testify that you have heard my voice, and know my words.” (D&C 18:34–36.)\nI begin by learning that all things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made. (See John 1:3.) It is plain that this great being, this Word, as John expressed it, was made flesh and dwelt among us (see John 1:14) and was identified as the Only Begotten in the flesh, the Lord Jesus Christ.\nI learn, too, that all of the children of God were organized as spirits to come to the earth to be tested, to see if they would obey the principles of salvation and exaltation as proposed by this Son. They were told: “We will go down, … and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell; And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.” (Abr. 3:24–25.) Then, in due time, he himself came to earth, the light and life of men. (See John 1:4.)\nBelieving this with all my heart, I read of the earthly life of this great being, the Messiah. I learn that when he was born, a host of angels sang anthems of joy to an audience of shepherds. Out of the East, with no explanation as to why they started, wise men came and deposited with Joseph and Mary presents which were of value: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. I do not doubt that they were inspired to find the Lord or that they were prompted to leave valuable gifts which could be used to sustain his family.\nI am thrilled when I read of the scene at Jordan. There came the Son of God, unmarked and unknown; yet, recognizing him by the Spirit, John the Baptist could not help crying out: “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.” (John 1:29.) What do you imagine could have been John’s feeling when, after the baptism, he heard a voice out of the heavens say in holy confirmation: “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased”? (Matt. 3:17.)\nThen later, as I follow his life, I sense the extraordinary importance of this climb up the mountain with three fishermen who did not yet quite know what it was to be apostles, to be special witnesses. There, as his glory was manifest before them and their eyes were opened to the presence of Moses and Elijah, they heard the same solemn witness as had John, only this time it came from a bright cloud nearby, which overshadowed them. In my soul I hear the solemn words from out the cloud saying: “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.” (Matt. 17:5.)\nThere are many events in the life of the Lord in which I experience exquisite joy as I read of them, and there are others which bow me down with the tragedy of his suffering and of his sacrifice.\nMany of us know what it is to suffer physically for ourselves, and we suffer mentally and emotionally for our friends and loved ones in their sorrows and afflictions. I am not capable of fully understanding the suffering of this great firstborn Son of God for the sins of the world. We call it Gethsemane. He gave us agency and then, knowing all would sin to a greater or lesser degree, took the responsibility on himself of paying the price of the atonement for our sins, provided we would repent and follow him and his teachings. I find peace in doing what he said to do. When he said: “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you …” (John 14:27), he meant what he said. Someday I hope to be able to understand better. I know the peace I can have if I will keep his law and abide in his commandments.\nI read that he was hung on a cross. I look at my own hands and feet and try to imagine the pain of such torture—to hang there in the heat of the day, the weight of his body on those tearing nails, every muscle and nerve drawn tight in agony. No stopping, no escape until he, having said, “It is finished” (John 19:30), gave up the ghost. I realize that this was endured for me and for you; I bow my head; it is hard to hold back the tears. Even now, 1900 years later, it is as poignant as though it occurred yesterday.\nI read on and discover that each one of the gospels ends on a triumphant note. He has risen! He is the King of kings. He is the one named “Wonderful, Counseller, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.” (Isa. 9:6.) I think of each of these titles given to him in prophecy and marvel as the meaning of each one touches my own heart.\nWhat did the 11 apostles think as the cloud received him out of their sight? I can see them, in my mind, walking across the Kedron, then the narrow streets to a common meeting place, each lost in his own fears, and in his own hopes according to his understanding. I read with gratitude of the great event of the day of Pentecost, when the promise of the Lord was realized and the Spirit of the Holy Ghost was on them in miraculous abundance.\nI am puzzled over the long period of time in which there was no spiritual light, nearly 1700 years of spiritual darkness. And then I read in a book of scripture, newly discovered, with an unusual name—the Book of Mormon—of his coming to a people in this land, a people descended from the Jews and their kin in Israel. I read of his descent from the heavens above them, of the great multitude of Nephites gathered together round about their temple, and of the voice from heaven which pierced them to the center.\nMy heart sings in confirmation as I hear once more in my soul the words of introduction and acceptance twice heard during his ministry in Palestine and now repeated and enlarged: “Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name—hear ye him.” (3 Ne. 11:7.) Once more the voice of the Father out of the cloud is placing his approval on his divine Son. I know that the account is true.\nI have already read of how this great personage lived as the firstborn of his Father in the spirit, and so I am not surprised, although I am deeply moved, to learn that he, as a premortal spirit, visited the brother of Jared (see Ether 3:6–13), and I can sense his fear when the brother of Jared saw the finger of the Lord and realized that it was like unto the finger of a man. It surprised this prophet, but it does not surprise me, for I have learned that the Lord was the firstborn Son of God, whose name is Man of Holiness. So when the Lord showed his complete self to that great prophet, I am not surprised, but I am awed. The more I study and read the scriptures, the more I know this is true.\nFinally, I read of a great vision in this dispensation, in this modern day. For the first time, so far as I know, the personage who spoke in testimony at the baptism of Christ, again on the mount, and to the Nephites (saying, “This is my beloved Son”) did not speak out of a cloud as on those occasions. This time he stood in majestic holy light together with his Son and declared to Joseph Smith: “This is My Beloved Son. Hear him!” (JS—H 1:17.) With Joseph Smith, as I read, I know that there is a God and he is indeed my Father. He is the great Elohim, the Father of us all. And there with him stood his Son Jesus Christ, identified once more by his Father.\nIt is no coincidence that the Father used the same introduction. If the young Joseph Smith was to bear witness of the truth, he must know the truth. It was revealed to him in that grove of trees 153 years ago. By the spirit of truth I know that the vision is true.\nFor 1700 years men had claimed to represent Christ, but none had declared him, none had heard a voice declaring him. In 1700 years no man had imagined or dared to imitate this great statement of truth to justify his own claims. This time is different. There in one moment on a spring morning the eternal truth was once more revealed in such a way and in such power that no one with the Holy Spirit in his heart can doubt that the heavens were opened and that God our Father and his Son appeared together—the Father declaring the Son in almost exactly the same words as he did three times nearly 2,000 years ago.\nThe boy was too young to perpetrate a fraud. The sacred words are from the lips of the Eternal Father. This is my testimony, and our testimony to the world. Here today we declared his Beloved Son, and here today we worship him and give praise and honor and glory. Today in honor of him we assemble at this conference of his people.\nWe look forward to his return to reign a thousand years. Let us worship him in spirit and in truth. Let us give loyal support to his presently anointed prophet and mouthpiece and those who assist him. President Harold B. Lee is that prophet. He holds the same keys that were given to Joseph Smith by the heavenly messengers in 1829. His word, inspired of the Holy Ghost, is the modern revelation of our day. This is my witness to you and to the world, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "My dear brothers and sisters: This has been a most stimulating and inspiring conference, and I sincerely pray for the guidance of the Spirit in the things that I have to say to you.\nFrequently the question is asked, What is the difference between The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and other churches?\nOn one occasion the Prophet Joseph Smith was asked this question. He replied that one of the main differences was in our mode of baptism, including the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, and that we believe in the continuing power of the Holy Ghost. (See vol. 4, p. 42.)\nThe first and fourth Articles of Faith of the Church outline this belief:\n“We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.\n“We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.”\nThrough modern revelation we are told that “the Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man’s, the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us.” (D&C 130:22.)\nThis is the simple and beautiful conception of the Godhead as taught by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nWhen Nicodemus, one of the rulers of the Jews, came to Jesus at night and asked him what he should do to be saved, he was told, “Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” (John 3:5.)\nIn this dispensation we have been admonished to “go among this people, and say unto them, … Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, … for the remission of sins; And whoso doeth this shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, by the laying on of the hands of the elders of the church.” (D&C 49:11, 13–14.)\nThat this new birth included a spiritual regeneration was indicated when the Savior explained, “That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.” (John 3:6–7.)\nFaith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance, and baptism by water are prerequisites to receiving the Holy Ghost.\nThe apostle Paul, in writing the Corinthian saints, stated: “… know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you …” (1 Cor. 6:19), and “If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are” (1 Cor. 3:17).\nTo keep in tune with the Holy Ghost, we must keep our bodies clean in every respect.\nPresident Brigham Young stated: “The Holy Ghost … opens the vision of the mind, unlocks the treasures of wisdom, and they begin to understand the things of God. … They comprehend themselves and the great object of their existence.” ( vol. 1, p. 241.)\nIf a person is going to get the most out of this life, he must comprehend the object of his existence.\nThe gifts of the Holy Ghost, to worthy recipients, are many and extremely helpful in answering the question, What is the purpose of life or the object of our existence?\nOne of the chief functions of the Holy Ghost is to bear witness of God the Father and Jesus Christ, his Son. The apostle Paul, in writing to the Corinthian saints, told them that “no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.” (1 Cor. 12:3.)\nTo know that God lives and that Jesus Christ is his Son and our Savior and Redeemer is absolutely essential to understand the purpose of life.\nIn addition to being a witness for the Father and the Son, the Holy Ghost is a comforter. As the Savior was about to be crucified, he promised the disciples another comforter as he told them, “… the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.” (John 14:26.)\nThus we see that the Holy Ghost is a witness of the Father and the Son, a comforter, a teacher, and the bearer of valuable gifts of the spirit, such as wisdom, knowledge, faith, discernment, and direction.\nYes, the blessings of the Holy Ghost are real and very helpful in understanding and appreciating life, although in some respects beyond our comprehension at times.\nI recall a testimony given by a young cadet attending the United States Air Force Academy.\nHe was experiencing great difficulty in passing his courses and was very discouraged. At this point, he met a Mormon cadet, and from him he learned that there were a number of Mormon boys attending the academy and that they met together at five o’clock each weekday morning in a religious study class. The cadet was invited to attend one of these classes.\nHe did so and was deeply impressed by the wonderful spirit. He continued attending, met the missionaries, was given the discussions, and, through study, prayer, and attending church, received a testimony and was baptized.\nHe bore witness that upon receiving the Holy Ghost he felt its influence quicken his mind and understanding and refresh his memory, and that thereafter he had no trouble in getting satisfactory grades. His feelings of discouragement left him, and a spirit of peace and comfort came over him. This was a most inspiring and impressive testimony of the great value of the Holy Ghost.\nLikewise, I have felt the guidance of the Holy Ghost many times in my life. In following these whisperings, my family and I have been blessed abundantly.\nWhen our children were young, we were living in Salt Lake City, and I had an opportunity to accept a position with the government in Washington, D.C. This was an important decision for our family to make. After very careful and prayerful consideration, we decided to accept. We felt good about this decision, but it took considerable courage to follow the inspiration.\nYears later, when I left the government, I had another important decision to make—whether to accept an attractive opportunity to work for others or go into business for myself. There were many pressures, many considerations, and after much deliberation I decided I would go into business for myself. After fervent prayers, I felt strongly that this was the path to pursue. I prayed for the courage to follow the whisperings of the Spirit.\nI am sure many of you could testify that you have been troubled in making important decisions and have asked the Lord for direction and guidance, and that you have received it.\nLikewise, manifestations of the Spirit are found in many other areas of life’s activities.\nWe hear many testimonies where worthy members have been warned of impending dangers.\nA young father bore witness to me of a great blessing that had come to him and his family. He was awakened one night by a voice that clearly told him to get up and go downstairs. He heeded the warning, and in going into the kitchen he found one wall engulfed in flames. Hurriedly he awakened his family, called the fire department, and with the help of his family fought the fire, keeping it down until the fire department arrived and put it out.\nThere was no question in his mind that this warning was a manifestation of the protection the Holy Ghost can give to those who keep their lives in harmony with the Spirit.\nAgain the Savior has promised that to worthy members the Holy Ghost would be a comforter in times of sickness and death.\nMany have borne witness of the comforting spirit that has attended them in times of sorrow, helping them to find peace and understanding.\nA few weeks ago it was my privilege to meet two wonderful women, close friends, who had lost their husbands in a tragic airplane accident. Did I find them in despair and deep mourning? No, indeed. I have never witnessed greater courage and strength. They both bore witness to the fact that they had truly felt the comfort of the Spirit, that they knew there was a purpose in the call that had been given to their husbands, and that they had an assurance that all would be well with them and their families as they lived close to the Church and kept the commandments of the Lord.\nI have heard the still small voice, or the whisperings of the Spirit, as I have counseled with you, my brothers and sisters; as I have conferred the priesthood upon men; as I have set men and women apart to positions in the Church; as I have given blessings to the sick; as I have borne my testimony to nonmembers as well as members; as I have been delivering a sermon, and at many other times.\nSometime ago a young lady asked me, “How do you know when you are speaking under the influence of the Holy Ghost?” My answer was, “I can feel it spiritually and physically.”\nI testify to you that the Holy Ghost has borne witness to me that God lives and is the Father of our spirits; that Jesus is the Christ, our Redeemer and Savior; that Joseph Smith was and is a great prophet, through whom the gospel in its fullness was restored, the church of Jesus Christ was reestablished, and the power to act in the name of God was restored to earth. The Holy Ghost has also borne witness to me many times that President Harold B. Lee is a great modern-day prophet, standing at the head of Christ’s church on this earth. I pray that the Lord and each one of us will sustain him in every way. I am most grateful for the influence of the Holy Ghost in my life.\nI bear my witness to you that as one accepts the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and conforms to the principles and ordinances thereof, the Holy Ghost will truly be a guide and comfort to him throughout his life.\nYes, one of the great differences between The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and any other church is that the worthy members may enjoy the continuing power and gifts of the Holy Ghost. May we all seek these gifts and be worthy of them, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "At this late hour of the conference, one would be hard pressed to find a subject regarding the teachings of the Savior that has not been touched upon. I would like to have the ability to summarize what has been said by the Brethren, but let me touch upon one of the occasions of the Master’s teachings.\nThis thought comes to me because we are approaching the season of the year when Christians around the world celebrate Easter by commemorating the events of the Savior’s last few days in mortality, his death, and his resurrection from the tomb. These happenings, which occurred many years ago in Jerusalem, are recalled to us by the writings of the New Testament. His death, however, did not bring his personal ministry to a conclusion.\nAn account in the Book of Mormon, a second witness for Christ, gives us additional knowledge of the teachings of the Master. This record tells of his appearance to the people of this Western Hemisphere after his death and resurrection, adding much to our understanding of the great atoning sacrifice.\nThe Nephite prophets foretold of the signs that would be given to the people of this continent at the crucifixion of the Savior, and according to their prophecies, a devastating tempest did burst upon the land. There was thunder and lightning greater than had ever been known, and earthquakes rocked the earth. The city of Zarahemla was burned by fire, the city of Moroni sank into the sea and the inhabitants drowned, and the city of Moronihah was covered by a mountain. Highways were broken up, other cities destroyed, and many people were slain or carried away by the tempest. The raging storm and devastation continued for three hours, and the face of the whole land was changed.\nAs the tempest ceased, a thick darkness gathered, and for three days no light was seen. Out of the darkness could be heard the great mourning, howling, and weeping of the people.\n“And it came to pass that there was a voice heard among all the inhabitants of the earth, upon all the face of the land, crying:\n“Wo, wo, wo unto this people; wo unto the inhabitants of the whole earth except they shall repent; for the devil laugheth, and his angels rejoice, because of the slain of the fair sons and daughters of my people; and it is because of their iniquity and abominations that they are fallen!” (3 Ne. 9:1–2.)\nThe voice enumerated the widespread destruction. The survivors of the tempest and earthquakes were declared to be the more righteous, and hope was offered to them through repentance and conversion to the gospel of the Savior.\nThe speaker then identified himself:\n“Behold, I am Jesus Christ the Son of God. I created the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are. I was with the Father from the beginning. I am in the Father, and the Father in me; and in me hath the Father glorified his name.\n“I came unto my own, and my own received me not. And the scriptures concerning my coming are fulfilled.” (3 Ne. 9:15–16.)\nThe Lord told them that the law of Moses had been fulfilled and he would no longer accept burnt offerings, but only the sacrifice of a broken heart and a contrite spirit.\n“Behold,” he said, “I have come unto the world to bring redemption unto the world, to save the world from sin.\n“Therefore, whoso repenteth and cometh unto me as a little child, him will I receive, for of such is the kingdom of God. Behold, for such I have laid down my life, and have taken it up again; therefore repent, and come unto me ye ends of the earth, and be saved.” (3 Ne. 9:21–22.)\nMany hours passed in silence and darkness, and again his voice was heard, sorrowing over his people and promising to gather them “as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings” (3 Ne. 10:6) if they would repent and follow him. Darkness continued, and on the morning of the third day the earth ceased to tremble and all became quiet and peaceful. Christ had risen from the tomb. Many of the righteous dead of this land in the Western Hemisphere rose from their graves, as did many saints in Judea.\nA multitude assembled at the temple in the land Bountiful. If we would join with them as we read, we would learn a great lesson. They talked about the changes that had taken place in the land because of the earthquakes and the inrush of the sea, and about Jesus Christ of whom these signs had been given. While they were conversing one with another, they heard a voice which said unto them: “Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name—hear ye him.” (3 Ne. 11:7.) They cast their eyes toward heaven and beheld a man clothed in a white robe who descended and stood in the midst of them.\n“And it came to pass that he stretched forth his hand and spake unto the people, saying:\n“Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world.\n“And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me. …\n“Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet. …” (3 Ne. 11:9–11, 14.)\nThe Master called twelve disciples and gave them the authority to baptize. He admonished the multitude to cease their contentions and disputations; and he taught them, among other things, truths he had proclaimed to his followers on the eastern continent—the Sermon on the Mount, the Lord’s Prayer, the fulfillment of the Mosaic law. He healed the sick, blessed little children, administered the sacrament and gave instruction concerning it.\nAs he taught the Nephites, the Savior defined his gospel. The statement he made to them describes the glories of the plan and explains the requirements for man to gain eternal life and exaltation. These are his words:\n“Behold, I have given unto you my gospel, and this is the gospel which I have given unto you—that I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.\n“And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me, that as I have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil.\n“And it shall come to pass, that whoso repenteth and is baptized in my name shall be filled; and if he endureth to the end, behold, him will I hold guiltless before my Father at that day when I shall stand to judge the world.\n“And he that endureth not unto the end, the same is he that is also hewn down and cast into the fire, from whence they can no more return, because of the justice of the Father.\n“Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day. Verily, verily, I say unto you, this is my gospel. …” (3 Ne. 27:13–14, 16–17, 20–21.)\nThe gospel is often referred to as the good news, or glad tidings of salvation. The plan of salvation, therefore, is the gospel of Jesus Christ. The Master explained to the Nephites that he had fulfilled his mission on earth by complying with the will of the Father, thereby becoming the Redeemer of all mankind. The further statement to “repent … and be baptized in my name” defines the gateway to the narrow path leading to eternal life. This gives rise to the fundamental statement expressed in the Articles of Faith of the Church:\n“We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.\n“We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.” (A of F 1:3–4.)\nThese four are only the first of all the principles and ordinances of the gospel. Returning to the words of the Savior to the Nephites, we learn that after complying with these four, there must be a lifetime of compliance with the laws and commandments of the Lord, for he said, “… and if he endureth to the end, behold, him will I hold guiltless before my Father at that day when I shall stand to judge the world.” (3 Ne. 27:16.)\nThe first principles alone are not sufficient: man is thereafter accountable in the eternal judgment for what he has done in life, whether good or evil. The atonement was for this very purpose, to bring about the resurrection and subsequent judgment of all men. The Master made it very clear by saying: “And for this cause have I been lifted up; therefore, according to the power of the Father I will draw all men unto me, that they may be judged according to their works.” (3 Ne. 27:15.)\nAn analysis divides the gospel plan into two parts:\nFirst, that which is preparatory and administered under the authority of the Aaronic Priesthood. The 84th section of the Doctrine and Covenants states it this way: “And the lesser priesthood continued, which priesthood holdeth the key of the ministering of angels and the preparatory gospel; Which gospel is the gospel of repentance and of baptism, and the remission of sins. …” (D&C 84:26–27.)\nSecond, the fullness of the gospel administered by the authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood. The same revelation makes this statement: “And this greater priesthood administereth the gospel and holdeth the key of the mysteries of the kingdom, even the key of the knowledge of God.\n“Therefore, in the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest.\n“And without the ordinances thereof, and the authority of the priesthood, the power of godliness is not manifest unto men in the flesh;\n“For without this no man can see the face of God, even the Father, and live.” (D&C 84:19–22.)\nFrom the teachings of the Savior to the Nephites during this brief period after his resurrection, the gospel plan is unfolded. The pathway of the preparatory gospel for the forgiveness of sins and entrance to the kingdom is clearly marked. The way is pointed out for the fullness of the everlasting gospel to be enjoyed by man, blessed by the Spirit of the Holy Ghost, to so live as to obtain a knowledge of God and receive his approbation upon resurrection.\nWe should be grateful, as Easter approaches, for the record of the people of the western world, which has preserved for us the teachings of the resurrected Savior to the Nephites. It is an additional witness to his divine mission. I know the Book of Mormon is the word of God.\nIt is my witness that Jesus is the Christ. If the world would follow the principles of the gospel proclaimed by him, a real peace, beyond the cessation of hostilities, would come to all people, for he said, “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you. …” (John 14:27.)\nMay this peace come to us by living the commandments of the Savior and by following the counsel of his prophet here upon the earth, I humbly pray, in the name of the Lord and Master, Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "We are grateful to all who have contributed to the success and inspiration of this conference, especially to our General Authorities who have delivered such timely, inspired messages. Sitting where we do as the First Presidency, we have been aware these last six months that there has been such a feeling of need to have questions answered, to have spoken from this pulpit at this conference things that are needed by so many in this mixed-up world, to help them to set guidelines for their own lives.\nI believe I have never known when the General Authorities have so completely covered the various areas where we have had great concern. If you want to know what the Lord has for this people at the present time, I would admonish you to get and read the discourses that have been delivered at this conference; for what these brethren have spoken by the power of the Holy Ghost is the mind of the Lord, the will of the Lord, the voice of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation. I am sure all who have listened, if they have been in tune, have felt the sincerity and the deep conviction from those who have spoken so appropriately and so effectively.\nMy soul is filled with joy as I think of these great men whom the Lord has brought to the service of the Church as General Authorities and all others who have served, our Regional Representatives of the Twelve, our Mission Representatives of the Twelve and the First Council of Seventy, and all who serve in the various organizations. As we have seen them being brought into key positions, we have marveled as to how, when we have need of a man or person for a particular office, the man of the hour seems to have been brought to us, almost in a miraculous way.\nAs I have listened to the brethren, and feeling the concern that has been so frequently referred to, I have remembered the instruction that was given by the prophet Alma as a group of those who had been converted waited on the banks for baptism; and as he explained to them the nature of the covenant in which they were to enter as baptized members, he said:\n“… as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another’s burdens, that they may be light;\n“Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, …\n“Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?” (Mosiah 18:8–10.)\n\nI call your attention to one of these requirements, particularly that which has been stressed by direct and indirect words in this conference: “are willing to bear one another’s burdens that they may be light.” If I were to ask you what is the heaviest burden one may have to bear in this life, what would you answer? The heaviest burden that one has to bear in this life is the burden of sin. How do you help one to bear that great burden of sin, in order that it might be light?\nSome years ago, President Romney and I were sitting in my office. The door opened and a fine young man came in with a troubled look on his face, and he said, “Brethren, I am going to the temple for the first time tomorrow. I have made some mistakes in the past, and I have gone to my bishop and my stake president, and I have made a clean disclosure of it all; and after a period of repentance and assurance that I have not returned again to those mistakes, they have now adjudged me ready to go to the temple. But, brethren, that is not enough. I want to know, and how can I know, that the Lord has forgiven me, also.”\nWhat would you answer one who would come to you asking that question? As we pondered for a moment, we remembered King Benjamin’s address contained in the book of Mosiah. Here was a group of people who now were asking for baptism, and they said they viewed themselves in their carnal state:\n“… And they all cried aloud with one voice, saying: O have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of Christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be purified; …\n“… after they had spoken these words the Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and they were filled with joy, having received a remission of their sins, and having peace of conscience. …” (Mosiah 4:2–3.)\nThere was the answer.\nIf the time comes when you have done all that you can to repent of your sins, whoever you are, wherever you are, and have made amends and restitution to the best of your ability; if it be something that will affect your standing in the Church and you have gone to the proper authorities, then you will want that confirming answer as to whether or not the Lord has accepted of you. In your soul-searching, if you seek for and you find that peace of conscience, by that token you may know that the Lord has accepted of your repentance. Satan would have you think otherwise and sometimes persuade you that now having made one mistake, you might go on and on with no turning back. That is one of the great falsehoods. The miracle of forgiveness is available to all of those who turn from their evil doings and return no more, because the Lord has said in a revelation to us in our day: “… go your ways and sin no more; but unto that soul who sinneth [meaning again] shall the former sins return, saith the Lord your God.” (D&C 82:7.) Have that in mind, all of you who may be troubled with a burden of sin.\nAnd to you who are teachers, may you help to lift that great burden from those who are carrying it, and who have their conscience so seared that they are kept from activity, and they don’t know where to go to find the answers. You help them to that day of repentance and restitution, in order that they too may have that peace of conscience, the confirming of the Spirit of the Lord that he has accepted of their repentance.\nThe great call has come now in the sermons of the brethren to aid those who are in need of aid, not just temporal aid, but spiritual aid. The greatest miracles I see today are not necessarily the healing of sick bodies, but the greatest miracles I see are the healing of sick souls, those who are sick in soul and spirit and are downhearted and distraught, on the verge of nervous breakdowns. We are reaching out to all such, because they are precious in the sight of the Lord, and we want no one to feel that they are forgotten.\nI read again and again the experience of Peter and John, as they went through the gate beautiful on the way to the temple. Here was one who had never walked, impotent from his birth, begging alms of all who approached the gate. And as Peter and John approached, he held out his hand expectantly, asking for alms. Peter, speaking for this pair of missionaries—church authorities—said, “Look on us.” And, of course, that heightened his expectation. “Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.” (Acts 3:4, 6.)\nNow in my mind’s eye I can picture this man, what was in his mind. “Doesn’t this man know that I have never walked? He commands me to walk.” But the biblical record doesn’t end there. Peter just didn’t content himself by commanding the man to walk, but he “took him by the right hand, and lifted him up.” (Acts 3:7.)\nWill you see that picture now of that noble soul, that chiefest of the apostles, perhaps with his arms around the shoulders of this man, and saying, “Now, my good man, have courage, I will take a few steps with you. Let’s walk together, and I assure you that you can walk, because you have received a blessing by the power and authority that God has given us as men, his servants.” Then the man leaped with joy.\nYou cannot lift another soul until you are standing on higher ground than he is. You must be sure, if you would rescue the man, that you yourself are setting the example of what you would have him be. You cannot light a fire in another soul unless it is burning in your own soul. You teachers, the testimony that you bear, the spirit with which you teach and with which you lead, is one of the most important assets that you can have, as you help to strengthen those who need so much, wherein you have so much to give. Who of us, in whatever station we may have been in, have not needed strengthening?\nMay I impose upon you for a moment to express appreciation for something that happened to me some time ago, years ago. I was suffering from an ulcer condition that was becoming worse and worse. We had been touring a mission; my wife, Joan, and I were impressed the next morning that we should get home as quickly as possible, although we had planned to stay for some other meetings.\nOn the way across the country, we were sitting in the forward section of the airplane. Some of our Church members were in the next section. As we approached a certain point en route, someone laid his hand upon my head. I looked up; I could see no one. That happened again before we arrived home, again with the same experience. Who it was, by what means or what medium, I may never know, except I knew that I was receiving a blessing that I came a few hours later to know I needed most desperately.\nAs soon as we arrived home, my wife very anxiously called the doctor. It was now about 11 o’clock at night. He called me to come to the telephone, and he asked me how I was; and I said, “Well, I am very tired. I think I will be all right.” But shortly thereafter, there came massive hemorrhages which, had they occurred while we were in flight, I wouldn’t be here today talking about it.\nI know that there are powers divine that reach out when all other help is not available. We see that manifest down in the countries we speak of as the underprivileged countries where there is little medical aid and perhaps no hospitals. If you want to hear of great miracles among these humble people with simple faith, you will see it among them when they are left to themselves. Yes, I know that there are such powers.\nAs I came to realize the overwhelming magnitude of the responsibility that now has been given to me, if I were to have sat down and tried to think of the burden, I would have been devastated and wholly incapable of carrying it. But when I was guided by the Spirit to name two noble men, whose powerful words of teaching and testimony you have heard today, President N. Eldon Tanner and President Marion G. Romney, I realized that mine was not the responsibility to carry these responsibilities alone. And then as we meet week by week in the temple and look across the room and see 12 stalwart men, men chosen from out the world and given the power of the holy apostleship, I am aware that no greater men walk the earth than these men.\nOnce each month on the first Thursday (it was a week ago last Thursday because of conference), we meet with all the General Authorities, except a few that are not able to be with us.\nWe have been glad that we had the appearance briefly of President Hugh B. Brown at this conference. We wish that Brother Alvin R. Dyer could have been here. Brother Alma Sonne has been able to be with us. We have talked with Sister Dyer, and we are praying earnestly that Brother Dyer may soon be recovered to his normal strength. These men and their families are carrying great burdens and responsibilities.\nThe other day we met in the seminar for Regional Representatives of the Twelve. These are men who are fanning out over the whole earth now, to every corner of the earth. Newly baptized members who know little about the gospel and much less about the disciplines of the Church must be taught if the Church is to be safely led. These men who have been chosen from out of the strongest men we have in the Church now are going out now under the direction of the Council of the Twelve. And there are also the Mission Representatives of the Twelve and the First Council of the Seventy associated with them. They are going out to the humblest everywhere and teaching them these fundamental principles, teaching them, as the Prophet Joseph answered when asked, “How do you govern your people?” His answer was, “I teach them correct principles, and they govern themselves.”\nThey are not going out to do the work themselves. As we have said to them, they are standing as “coaches” rather than as “quarterbacks” on the football team, teaching the quarterbacks how to direct, teaching them correct principles. They are men of faith. And how grateful we are for all these auxiliary workers who have gone out, likewise at great expense, great travel, and sacrifice on the part of their businesses and their families.\nTo you great leaders, stake presidencies, mission presidencies, bishoprics, priesthood quorum leaders, all of you, the faithful Saints everywhere, you who pray for us, I want you to know that we pray earnestly at the altars of the temple for all of you faithful who pray for us. How grateful we are for you!\nAs I come to you at the closing moments of this conference, I would like to take you back now to just one incident, and I am sorry that I can tell you only a part of it because of the limitations of some things contained therein.\nIt was just before the dedication of the Los Angeles Temple. We were all preparing for that great occasion. It was something new in my life, when along about three or four o’clock in the morning, I enjoyed an experience that I think was not a dream, but it must have been a vision. It seemed that I was witnessing a great spiritual gathering, where men and women were standing up, two or three at a time, and speaking in tongues. The spirit was so unusual. I seemed to have heard the voice of President David O. McKay say, “If you want to love God, you have to learn to love and serve the people. That is the way you show your love for God.” And there were other things then that I saw and heard.\nAnd so I come to you today, with no shadow of doubting in my mind that I know the reality of the person who is presiding over this church, our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ. I know that he is. I know that he is closer to us than many times we have any idea. They are not an absentee Father and Lord. They are concerned about us, helping to prepare us for the advent of the Savior, whose coming certainly isn’t too far away because of the signs that are becoming apparent.\nAll you need to do is to read the scriptures, particularly the inspired translation of Matthew, the twenty-fourth chapter, found in the writings of Joseph Smith in the Pearl of Great Price [JS—M 1], where the Lord told his disciples to stand in holy places and be not moved, for he comes quickly, but no man knows the hour nor the day. That is the preparation.\nGo home now to your people, I pray you, and say as did Joshua of old: “… as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.” (Josh. 24:15.) Teach your families in your family home evening, teach them to keep the commandments of God, for therein is our only safety in these days. If they will do that, the powers of the Almighty will descend upon them as the dews from heaven, and the Holy Ghost will be theirs, which has been spoken of so excellently by Elder Franklin D. Richards. That can be our guide, and that kind of Spirit shall guide us and direct us to his holy home.\nAnd so as it is my privilege to do, I give you faithful members of the Church everywhere my blessing. God bless you, take care of you, preserve you as you travel home, that there may be no accident or no untoward experience. Take to your people out in the far reaches the feeling of love that we have for all of them; and indeed, as the missionaries go out, that love extends not only to those of our Father’s children who are already members of the Church, but those who are our Father’s children to whom he would have us bring the gospel of truth; make them also to enjoy all the blessings that we now have.\nMay the Lord help us so to understand and do, and fill our stations, and not be found wanting in the day of judgment that we have not done all we know how to do to advance his work in righteousness, I humbly pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen."
