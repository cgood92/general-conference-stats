        "content": "Welcome to general conference. How grateful we are to be gathered.\nAs we anticipate these conference proceedings, we are acutely aware of the weeks leading up to it. We realize that our hearts are mourning loss, and some feel uncertainty caused by violence or tragedy throughout the world. Even devout people gathered in sacred spaces—including our hallowed chapel in Michigan—have lost their lives or loved ones. I speak from my heart, realizing that many of your hearts are burdened by what you, your families, and our world have undergone since last general conference.\n\nCapernaum in Galilee\n\nImagine with me you are a young teenager in Capernaum, near the Sea of Galilee, during the ministry of Jesus Christ. Word spreads of a rabbi—a teacher—whose message draws multitudes. Neighbors plan to travel to a mount overlooking the sea to hear Him.\nYou join others walking the dusty roads of Galilee. Upon your arrival, the large crowd gathered to hear this Jesus surprises you. Some quietly whisper, “Messiah.”\nYou listen. His words touch your heart. On the long walk home, you choose quiet over conversation.\nYou ponder wondrous things—things that transcend even the law of Moses. He spoke of turning the other cheek and loving your enemies. He promised, “Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.”\nIn your reality, as you feel the weight of difficult days—uncertainty and fear—peace feels distant.\nYour pace quickens; you arrive home breathless. Your family gathers; your father asks, “Tell us what you heard and feel.”\nYou share that He invited you to let your light shine before others, to seek righteousness even when persecuted. Your voice catches as you repeat, “Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.”\nYou ask, “Can I truly become a peacemaker when the world is in commotion, when my heart is filled with fear, and when peace seems so far away?”\nYour father glances at your mother and answers gently, “Yes. We begin in the most basic place—in our hearts. Then in our homes and families. As we practice there, peacemaking can spread to our streets and villages.”\n\nFast Forward 2,000 Years\n\nFast forward 2,000 years. No need to imagine—this is our reality. Although the pressures felt by today’s rising generation differ from those of the young person in Galilee—polarization, secularization, retaliation, road rage, outrage, and social media pile-ons—both generations face cultures of conflict and tension.\nGratefully, our young men and women are similarly drawn to their Sermon-on-the-Mount moments: seminary, For the Strength of Youth conferences, and Come, Follow Me. Here they receive the same enduring invitations from the Lord: to let their light shine before others, to seek righteousness even when persecuted, and to love their enemies.\nThey also receive encouraging words from living prophets of the Restoration: “Peacemakers needed.” Disagree without being disagreeable. Replace contention and pride with forgiveness and love. Build bridges of cooperation and understanding, not walls of prejudice or segregation. And the same promise: “Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.”\nThe hearts of today’s rising generation are filled with a testimony of Jesus Christ and a hope for the future. Yet they too ask, “Can I truly become a peacemaker when the world is in commotion, my heart is filled with fear, and peace seems so far away?”\nThe resounding response is once again yes! We embrace the words of the Savior: “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you. … Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.”\nToday, peacemaking still begins in the most basic place—in our hearts. Then in homes and families. As we practice there, peacemaking will spread into our neighborhoods and communities.\nLet’s further consider these three places where a modern-day Latter-day Saint makes peace.\n\nPeacemaking in Our Hearts\n\nThe first is in our hearts. A visible element of Christ’s ministry demonstrates how children were drawn to Him. Therein lies a clue. Looking into the pure and innocent peacemaking heart of a child can be an inspiration for our hearts. Here is how several Primary-age children answered “What does it look like to be a peacemaker?”\nI share their responses straight from their hearts! Luke said, “Always help others.” Grace shared how important it is to forgive each other, even when it doesn’t feel fair. Anna said, “I saw someone who didn’t have anyone to play with, so I went to play with her.” Lindy reflected that to be a peacemaker is to help others. “Then you pass it on. It will just keep going on and on.” Liam said, “Don’t be mean to people, even if they are mean to you.” London exclaimed, “If someone teases or is mean to you, you say, ‘Please stop.’” Trevor observed, “If there is one donut left and you all want it, you share.”\nThese children’s responses are evidence to me that we are all born with divine inclinations toward kindness and compassion. The gospel of Jesus Christ nurtures and knits these divine traits, including peacemaking, into our hearts, blessing us in this life and the next.\n\nPeacemaking at Home\n\nSecond, building peacemaking in our homes by using the Lord’s pattern to influence our relationships with one another: persuasion, long-suffering, gentleness, kindness, meekness, and love unfeigned.\nHere is an inspiring story that demonstrates how one family made peacemaking a family affair, putting these principles into practice.\nChildren in this family were struggling in their relationship with an adult whose demeanor was often grumpy, condescending, and curt. The children, hurt and frustrated, began to wonder if the only way forward was to mirror that same mean-spirited behavior.\nOne evening the family spoke openly together about the tension and the toll it was taking. And then an idea emerged—not just a solution but an experiment.\nInstead of responding with silence or retaliation, the children would do something unexpected: they would respond with kindness. Not just polite restraint but a deliberate, heartfelt outpouring of kind words and thoughtful deeds, no matter how they were treated in return. All agreed to try it for a set time, after which they’d regroup and reflect.\nThough some were hesitant at first, they committed to the plan with genuine hearts.\nWhat happened next was nothing short of remarkable.\nThe cold exchanges began to thaw. Smiles replaced scowls. The adult, once distant and harsh, began to change. The children, empowered by their choice to lead with love, found joy in the transformation. The change was so profound that the planned follow-up meeting was never needed. Kindness had done its quiet work.\nIn time, true bonds of friendship were formed, lifting everyone. To be peacemakers, we forgive others and deliberately build others up instead of tearing them down.\n\nPeacemaking in Our Communities\n\nThird, peacemaking in our communities. In the troubled years of World War II, Elder John A. Widtsoe taught: “The only way to build a peaceful community is to build men and women who are lovers and makers of peace. Each individual, by that doctrine of Christ … holds in his hands the peace of the [whole] world.”\nThe following story beautifully illustrates that precept.\nSeveral years ago, two men—a Muslim imam and a Christian pastor from Nigeria—stood on opposite sides of a painful religious divide. Each had suffered deeply. And yet, through the healing power of forgiveness, they chose to walk a path together.\n\nImam Muhammad Ashafa and Pastor James Wuye became friends and unlikely partners in peace. Together they established a center for interfaith mediation. They now teach others to replace hatred with hope. As two-time nominees for the Nobel Peace Prize, they recently became inaugural recipients of the Commonwealth Peace Prize.\nThese former enemies now travel side by side rebuilding what was broken, living witnesses that the Savior’s invitation to be peacemakers is not only possible—it is powerful.\nWhen we come to know the glory of God, then we “will not have a mind to injure one another, but to live peaceably.” In our congregations and our communities, may we choose to see one another as children of God.\n\nA One-Week Peacemaker Plan\n\nIn summary, I offer an invitation. Peacemaking demands action—what might that be, for each of us, starting tomorrow? Would you consider a one-week, three-step peacemaker plan?\n\nA contention-free home zone: When contention starts, pause and reboot with kind words and deeds.\n\nDigital bridge building: Before posting, replying, or commenting online, ask, Will this build a bridge? If not, stop. Do not send. Instead, share goodness. Publish peace in the place of hate.\n\nRepair and reunite: Each family member could seek out a strained relationship in order to apologize, minister, repair, and reunite.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt has been a few months since I felt an undeniable impression leading to this message: “Blessed Are the Peacemakers.” In conclusion, may I share impressions that have pressed upon my heart over this time.\nPeacemaking is a Christlike attribute. Peacemakers are sometimes labeled naive or weak—from all sides. Yet, to be a peacemaker is not to be weak but to be strong in a way that the world may not understand. Peacemaking requires courage and compromise but does not require sacrifice of principle. Peacemaking is to lead with an open heart, not a closed mind. It is to approach one another with extended hands, not clenched fists. Peacemaking is not a new thing, hot off the press. It was taught by Jesus Christ Himself, both to those in the Bible and the Book of Mormon. Peacemaking has since been taught by modern-day prophets from the earliest days of the Restoration even to this day.\nWe fulfill our divine role as children of a loving Heavenly Father as we strive to become peacemakers. I bear testimony of Jesus Christ, who is the Prince of Peace, the Son of the living God, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "One of the blessings of my service in Primary is that my heart has learned to love in languages that my tongue does not speak. I have found joy in connecting with fellow Saints through the shared language of sacred music. And especially through the simple songs of Primary, the Holy Spirit has transcended language barriers and filled my heart with His whispering. In children’s voices, the love of God and His Son, Jesus Christ, has been proclaimed in clear, piercing truth.\nAlthough I did not grow up in Primary, the Spirit has quickly taught me the sacredness of its songs, and they have become part of my personal worship. Primary songs have carried a holy influence in my life and have lifted my soul, taught me eternal truths, and drawn me nearer to the Savior and to His gospel.\nPresident Dallin H. Oaks once taught that “the singing of hymns is one of the best ways to learn the doctrine of the restored gospel.” Those words are true for all of us but are especially so for children. Primary music is one of God’s most tender tools for planting the seeds of testimony in the hearts of the Savior’s youngest disciples. Parents, leaders, and teachers give nourishment to that seed as they testify to and invite the testimonies of children of all they are coming to know of Heavenly Father; His Son, Jesus Christ; and the Holy Ghost.\nIn these last several years of my service, I have spent time singing and learning from Primary music while contemplating a few questions:\n\nHow can Primary songs learned in childhood become the spiritual language children use to testify for the rest of their lives?\n\nHow does singing gospel truths help children remember the Lord as part of their covenant and prepare them for His ordinances?\n\nAnd how can Primary songs help write God’s law upon the hearts of these youngest disciples?\n\nWhen Primary began in 1878, its first president, Aurelia Spencer Rogers, observed that “singing was necessary.” Music has always been at the heart of teaching children the gospel. Primary songs can become a child’s first spiritual language because their simple, memorable melodies give voice to gospel truths. These songs hold the power to stay with children for a lifetime, becoming part of their discipleship and a natural and normal way for them to testify of the Savior.\n\nTeaching the Doctrine of Jesus Christ Through Song\n\nPrimary songs can also be powerful doctrinal teaching tools. Some songs tell the stories of the Savior’s life and ministry. Others teach of His attributes, such as His faith, His hope, and His charity. And the most sacred songs testify of His infinite Atonement and the love that flows from that act of salvation.\nA prophet of the Lord, President Russell M. Nelson, taught: “[Music] can exert a continuing influence for good well beyond times when children are small. … [It] has [the] power to provide spiritual nourishment. It has healing power. It has [the] power to facilitate worship; it allows us to contemplate the [Savior’s] Atonement and the Restoration of the gospel with its saving principles and exalting ordinances. Music provides power for us to express prayerful thoughts and bear testimony of sacred truths.”\nAs parents, leaders, and teachers, our effort includes helping children access these promised blessings by teaching with intention the gospel truths found in the music. President Nelson also taught that “children can learn the doctrine when they’re learning to sing just as much as they can learn the doctrine in a class.” These songs can provide a reservoir of faith-filled sermons that point children to the Savior and help them develop devotion to His gospel.\nThe scriptures teach that the songs of the righteous that come from the heart are a delight to the Savior. I can only wonder at the delight that the voices of the Savior’s youngest disciples bring. I know their prayerful songs reach heaven as expressions of faith that invite the Holy Spirit to confirm eternal truths and softly and tenderly invite others to accept the call of our Savior to follow Him and come home. As Elder Henry B. Eyring has reminded us, it is in those moments of feeling the Spirit that we have evidence of the Savior’s Atonement working in our lives.\n\nImprinting Truth on the Heart\n\nPrimary music can be a miracle carried along the lifelong arc of discipleship that our children will travel. A song learned at age six has the power to stay with us—and can return decades later in moments of decision, temptation, grief, or joy. Perhaps in our later years, the lyrics of “I Will Follow God’s Plan” may serve as a spiritual anchor that echoes the witness of the Apostle Paul of the surety of God’s promises to us. Or they may remind us that because God keeps His promises, His covenants offer strong consolation and a place of refuge and invite us to put our hope and assurance steadfastly on Jesus Christ and in His atoning power.\nAdult members across the globe, in times of difficulty, often remember and turn to the Primary songs they learned as children. For many, these songs supported the early architecture of their faith in Jesus Christ and were often the first place where conversion to His gospel began. Parents, leaders, and teachers nurtured that faith through the years by teaching, singing, and testifying to children with care.\nOne sister shared with me that she cherished Primary music, and after 20 years she credits it with accelerating her continued conversion to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Another member testified that Primary planted a mustard seed of faith when he was young and was the reason he was able to come back to the Lord’s Church in his 30s. The Savior promised, “The Comforter … shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance.” Primary music can be one way that promise is fulfilled.\nAnother beloved Primary song captures the power of simple faith and enduring testimony:\n\nAs I walk with Jesus to my home above,\nHe will bless me with His Spirit and fill me with His love,\nChange my heart forever and help me clearly see.\nI will walk with Jesus, and He will walk with me.\n\nAs children sing, they are expressing the desire of a disciple and learning the pattern of covenant living. The Spirit can use music to engrave eternal truths on their tender hearts. And in time, children can choose to tune and turn their hearts and their lives toward Jesus Christ by making and keeping sacred covenants with Him.\n\nRemembering Our Covenants and Preparing for Ordinances\n\nSacred music can help write the doctrine of Christ into the soul and prepare us to receive His ordinances. It links the Savior’s doctrine to our memory and that memory to our discipleship in Him.\nAs Primary leaders, we have the opportunity and the sacred responsibility to ensure that music in Primary is taught with joy, with doctrinal understanding, and with the Spirit. This includes inviting children to notice what they feel as they sing and helping them recognize that those feelings come from the Holy Ghost. These efforts help prepare our children for sacred ordinances, such as baptism and confirmation, as well as inspiring their covenant memory as they regularly renew their promises to God.\nAt the Last Supper, after the Savior instituted the sacrament, Matthew records that “when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.” Each week, baptized and confirmed members of the Lord’s restored Church, including baptized children as young as eight years old, prepare to take the Lord’s sacrament. Through singing sacred music, congregations of God’s children are given an opportunity to prepare their hearts for that sacred ordinance to take upon themselves His name, to always remember Him, and to keep His commandments.\n\nClosing Testimony\n\nDear friends, I testify that Primary songs teach eternal truths and doctrine that lead us to Jesus Christ and His gospel. I invite you to consider what foundational truths have been written into your hearts through the simple teachings of these songs and to testify of those truths to the Savior’s youngest disciples as you teach them the good news of the gospel through song.\nI know that God our Father, in His infinite love, sent His Beloved Son to earth to teach us, to show us the way, and to redeem us through His Atonement.\nI know that the Savior’s life and ministry are real and personal. The scriptures are full of stories of His healing, His kindness, and His miracles.\nI know that Heavenly Father hears and answers the sincere prayers of His children, no matter their age, circumstance, or language. He listens to the quiet pleadings of our hearts.\nI testify that in Gethsemane, Jesus Christ bore the weight of our sins, sorrows, and pains. He suffered willingly because of His love for us and made it possible for us to be forgiven and to return home.\nI know that we are literal children of God, created in His image, endowed with divine potential, and invited to return to live with Him if we choose to follow Jesus Christ.\nI know that Jesus Christ is our perfect example, and as we follow Him by serving, forgiving, and loving others, we become more like Him day by day.\nAnd I know that the Lord’s holy temples are His house here on earth. In them, we make sacred covenants, receive eternal blessings, and learn more of Him and feel more of His presence. The temple is a place of learning, peace, and preparation for our lives.\nI testify that the efforts we make to teach and sing these Primary songs to our children are not simply a nice part of our religious tradition. They are sermons for disciples of Jesus Christ, testimonies to the truthfulness of the restored gospel, and prayers set to music. Sacred music can shine the Light of Christ on the hearer and can pour it into the heart of the singer. Dear friends, Jesus still wants us for a sunbeam. I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "When commanded to choose the new king of Israel from among the sons of Jesse, the prophet Samuel, upon looking at Jesse’s oldest son, Eliab, exclaimed with enthusiasm, “Surely the Lord’s anointed is before him.” But Eliab was not the Lord’s chosen servant. The Savior warned Samuel: “Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.”\nWhile David may not have been physically the strongest or most skilled of his brothers, his heart was strong in the sight of God. He loved God with all his heart and had a deep desire to obey Him. He had unwavering faith in God’s love, power, and promised blessings, as he later demonstrated when he fearlessly fought and defeated Goliath with the Lord’s help.\nThis story teaches us that all God needs to accomplish His purposes and to help us become who He wants us to become is for each of us to turn our hearts fully to Him. To a lawyer, He commanded, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart.” To the Prophet Joseph Smith, He said, “Behold, the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind.” And to the Nephites, the resurrected Savior extended this invitation: “Ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit.”\nWhy is that so? The Savior taught that if our hearts are fully turned to Him, because of His atoning sacrifice we can be blessed with the strength and spiritual gifts we need to overcome our mortal challenges, resist temptation, receive direction and understanding, and feel joy and peace in our lives. “Out of small things proceedeth that which is great.” He said He can “make weak things become strong” and bless us with everything we need to succeed in this mortal life and to receive eternal life. “Blessed are the pure in heart,” He said, “for they shall see God.”\nI believe this is why, at least in part, Jesus Christ so often corrected the scribes and Pharisees during His mortal ministry. Though diligent in keeping His law, they did so for the wrong reasons. He rebuked them, saying, “This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.”\nThis is a sober reminder to all His disciples that it is not just about what we do—our words and actions—but also why we do what Jesus Christ has asked us to do—our desires and motives. He said, “For I, the Lord, will judge all men according to their works, according to the desire of their hearts.” Our Heavenly Father desires more than mechanical acts of obedience and service from His children. He wants us to do those things with real intent because we love Him with all our hearts. He wants us to desire to become like Him.\nNow, if the spiritual health of our hearts is a main concern of the Savior—what He looks for in a true disciple—how can we examine our heart and know if it is right in the sight of God?\nRecently, as my wife and I returned from our mission in Portugal, we ran a series of health tests to evaluate our physical condition. Some of those tests focused on our hearts’ health—such as blood tests, echocardiograms, and stress tests. I believe the Savior has also provided us with a set of spiritual tests we can use to assess our hearts’ spiritual condition. Let me share a few with you.\n\nAssessing Your Heart with Spiritual Tests\n\nFirst, Our Focus, Priorities, and Motives\n\n“For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also,” Jesus taught. A treasure is something precious to us, something to which we dedicate effort and attention. Where we choose to spend our time and focus our attention, as well as what motivates us to do what we do, says a lot about our hearts. The Savior warned that while many are called by Him, few are chosen “because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and [they] aspire to the honors of men.” Do I make the Savior a priority in my life? Is my eye single to His glory in all that I do?\n\nSecond, Our Willingness to Obey God’s Commandments\n\nThroughout scripture, the Lord and His prophets have associated pride and disobedience with having a hardened heart. Nephi exhorted his brothers, saying: “How is it that ye do not keep the commandments of the Lord? How is it that ye will perish, because of the hardness of your hearts?” To the Saints in Missouri, the Lord warned, “But he that doeth not anything until he is commanded, and receiveth a commandment with doubtful heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness, the same is damned.” While the Savior does not expect perfection in keeping His commandments, He does ask that we desire and strive to keep them with all our hearts.\n\nThird, Our Diligence in Studying the Scriptures and Seeking Revelation\n\nThe Lord admonished Oliver Cowdery to “treasure up these words in thy heart.” We’re invited to search the scriptures diligently and, through the power of the Holy Ghost, seek to obtain understanding and a witness of the truthfulness of the gospel in our hearts.\nThe prophet Abinadi rebuked the priests of the wicked King Noah for not doing that, saying, “Ye have not applied your hearts to understanding; therefore, ye have not been wise.” Am I making a sincere effort to study the scriptures daily and to apply my heart to understand them through prayer?\n\nFourth, Our Thoughts and Words\n\nThe Savior taught that “out of the heart proceed evil thoughts” and that “out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.” The quality of our thoughts and words is a good indicator of the purity of our hearts. Am I fostering too many negative thoughts about others’ actions or motives, or even about myself? Am I too quick to judge and condemn others? Do I seek to find excuses or justification for my mistakes? And what about my words? Do they lift and inspire those around me? Or do they often create conflict and resentment?\nAfter my physical tests were completed, my doctor told me that, overall, my heart was healthy—but there were a few concerns that needed to be addressed now, before they became serious. He then prescribed some lifestyle changes. Likewise, as you perform this spiritual assessment of your heart and notice some negative symptoms starting to creep in, please don’t panic! The Savior has provided excellent spiritual medication and treatment to help you. He has even promised to give you a new heart! Here are some actions that can improve your heart’s spiritual strength.\n\nImproving Your Heart’s Spiritual Health\n\nFirst, Strengthen Your Relationship with Christ\n\nAs we dedicate time daily to come closer to Christ, our hearts are changed. Daily study of the scriptures, accompanied by sincere prayer and regular fasting, will increase your love for the Savior and strengthen your faith and desire to repent and humbly yield your heart to God. Consider this example from Nephi: “Wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father.”\nAs we continue to nourish the seed of faith by our righteous desires and actions, we will experience the same sanctification of our hearts as the Nephites: “They did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation, yea, even to the purifying and the sanctification of their hearts, which sanctification cometh because of their yielding their hearts unto God.”\n\nSecond, Align Your Will with His\n\nThe Savior taught, “If ye love me, keep my commandments⁠.” He invites us to demonstrate our love by making and keeping covenants with Him. As we strive daily to keep His commandments, sincerely repent from our sins, and persevere in taking His name upon us and aligning our will with His will, we can be blessed with the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost.\nNephi testified, “I know that if ye shall follow the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent, repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of Christ, by baptism … , then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost.” The Holy Ghost will guide you and help you know the will of the Lord and make good choices.\n\nLast, Serve God and Others with All Your Heart\n\nThe Savior invites all to “serve him with all your heart.” When we choose to do each thing the Lord has asked us to do—such as keeping the commandments, partaking of the sacrament, worshipping in the temple, and serving others—with a sincere heart and with real intent, each act of service and worship becomes a powerful spiritual experience that strengthens our faith and testimony and fills our hearts with joy and love for God and our fellow man.\nThe prophet Alma’s question still echoes today: “Have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?”\nBrothers and sisters, I invite you to give your whole heart to the Savior today. Let each act of worship and service be sincere and intentional. Set aside the distractions of the world and strive to have meaningful time for the Lord every day of your lives. Repent and return to Him with all your heart, and He will forgive you and encircle you in the arms of His love. Seek not the things of this world, but choose to have your eye single to His glory and seek the things of a better one. He knows your thoughts and the desires of your heart, and as you come unto Him, He will bless you with strength, confidence, peace, and joy in this life and a place in His celestial kingdom for all eternity.\nI know Jesus Christ lives. He is our Redeemer. And He loves you and me with all His heart. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "Several years ago our daughter had a profound experience on her mission. With her approval, I share an excerpt of what she wrote to us that week:\n“Yesterday a returning member asked us to come over as soon as possible. When we arrived, we found her on the floor, sobbing uncontrollably. Through the tears, we found out that she had lost her job, was going to be evicted from her apartment, and once again become homeless.”\nOur daughter continued: “I started frantically searching my scriptures, trying to find something—anything—to help her. As I was looking for the perfect verse, I thought, ‘What am I doing? This is not what Christ would do. This is not a problem that I can solve, but this is a literal daughter of God who needs my help.’ So I closed my scriptures, knelt beside her, and held her while we cried together, until she was ready to stand up and face this trial.”\nAfter this woman was comforted, our daughter then used the scriptures to try and help her understand the reality of her divine worth and to teach her one of the most fundamental truths of our existence—that we are beloved sons and daughters of God, a God that feels perfect compassion for us when we suffer and is ready to assist us as we stand back up.\nIt is insightful that the first point of doctrine that our missionaries teach is that God is our loving Heavenly Father. Every subsequent truth builds on the foundational understanding of who we really are.\nSusan H. Porter, Primary General President, taught: “When you know and understand how completely you are loved as a child of God, it changes everything. It changes the way you feel about yourself when you make mistakes. It changes how you feel when difficult things happen. It changes your view of God’s commandments. It changes your view of others and of your capacity to make a difference.”\nThis change is illustrated as we read about the experience Moses had when talking with God face-to-face. During that conversation, God repeatedly taught Moses of his divine heritage, saying, “Moses, … thou art my son.” God explained that Moses was in the similitude of His Only Begotten. Moses came to understand clearly who he was, that he had a work to do, and that he had a loving Heavenly Father.\nAfter this experience, the adversary came tempting him and immediately addressed him by saying, “Moses, son of man.” This is a common and dangerous tool in the arsenal of the adversary. While our Heavenly Father consistently and lovingly reminds us that we are His children, the adversary will always try to label us by our weaknesses. But Moses had already learned that he was more than a “son of man.” He declared to Satan: “Who art thou? For behold, I am a son of God.” Similarly, when we are confronted with the challenges of mortality or when we feel like anyone is trying to label us by our weaknesses, we need to stand strong in the knowledge of who we truly are. We must seek validation vertically, not horizontally. And as we do, we too can boldly proclaim, “I am a child of God.”\nIn a worldwide devotional for young adults, our beloved President Russell M. Nelson taught: “So who are you? First and foremost, you are a child of God, a child of the covenant, and a disciple of Jesus Christ. As you embrace these truths, our Heavenly Father will help you reach your ultimate goal of living eternally in His holy presence.”\nIt is no coincidence that in likely the most repeated scripture, God reminds us of our relationship with Him. Of all the names He could be identified by in the sacrament prayer, He has asked to be called “God, the Eternal Father.”\nAs we come to truly know who we are, we will believe more strongly that our loving Heavenly Father has provided a plan for us to return to live with Him again. Elder Patrick Kearon taught: “Our Father’s beautiful plan, even His ‘fabulous’ plan, is designed to bring you home, not to keep you out. … God is in relentless pursuit of you.” Think about that for a moment—our all-powerful, loving Father is in “relentless pursuit of you.”\nRegardless of where we are on our path of discipleship, our lives will fundamentally change if we better understand who we really are. May I suggest two ways in which we can deepen this understanding.\n\nFirst, Prayer\n\nAs the Savior was beginning His mortal ministry, he was led into the wilderness to “be with God.” Perhaps we should shift our mindset away from simply saying our prayers to taking sufficient time to really commune with and “be with God” each day.\nI have found that the quality of my prayers improves as I take a few minutes to prepare to talk to my Father. The scriptures show us that this is a pattern that works. Whether it is Joseph Smith; Nephi, the son of Helaman; or Enos, all have some form of pondering and reflecting prior to their recorded communication with God. Enos said that his soul hungered as the words of his father sunk deep into his heart. Each of these examples teaches us the need to spiritually prepare for our time each day to “be with God.”\nTo the Nephites, the Savior instructed, “When thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father.”\nWhether it is in a closet or a bedroom, the principle is to find a place where you can be alone to pray, to allow your soul to be still, and to feel the promptings of the “still small voice.” We can prepare by pondering on the things that we are grateful for and the questions or concerns that we would like to bring to our Father. We should strive not to have a rote manner of prayer but to talk with our Father, out loud if possible.\nI realize that in the chaos of our lives, when we are wrestling with toddlers or running between meetings, we may not have the luxury of quiet closets and thoughtful preparation—but those silent, quick, and urgent prayers can be much more meaningful when we have made an effort to “be with God” earlier in the day.\nThere may be some who haven’t prayed for a long time or others who haven’t felt that their prayers are being heard. I promise you that your Heavenly Father knows you, loves you, and wants to hear from you. He wants to communicate with you. He wants you to remember who you are.\nElder Jeffrey R. Holland recently taught: “However much you are praying, pray more. However hard you are praying, pray harder.”\nIn addition to increasing the frequency and fervency of our prayers, studying the Book of Mormon daily and worshipping in the temple will help prepare our minds for revelation. As we strive to improve our communication with our Heavenly Father, He will bless us to feel more profoundly that we are His children.\n\nSecond, Come to Know That Jesus Is the Christ\n\nThe greatest manifestation of Heavenly Father’s love for us as His children is the reality that He sent His Son, our own personal Savior, to help us come home. Therefore, we need to come to know Him.\nYears ago, while serving as a stake president, I submitted a recommendation for a brother to serve as an ordinance worker in the temple. After explaining what a wonderful ordinance worker he would be, I inadvertently pressed “Do not endorse,” which submitted the recommendation. After unsuccessfully trying to recall the message, I called the temple president and said, “I have made a horrible mistake.” Without hesitation, this good temple president said, “President Eyre, there is nothing that you have done that can’t be forgiven and ultimately corrected.” What a great truth. Indeed, Jesus Christ is “mighty to save.”\nIn 2019 there was a profound change in the temple recommend questions. Previously, one question asked if you had a testimony of Jesus Christ’s role as Savior and Redeemer. It now asks if you have a testimony of His role as your Savior and Redeemer. Jesus Christ’s Atonement not only works for others; it works for you and for me. He is my Savior. He is your Savior. Individually. Only through Him can you and I return to be with our Father.\nSo, brothers and sisters, let us seek Him. Let us study His divine relationship with the Father and with each of us. Let us experience the song of redeeming love that comes personally to each one of us through our Redeemer as we repent. As we come to know “him who is mighty to save,” we will come to understand that we, as children of God, are His joy—His most important focus—and we are indeed each worth saving.\nI testify that we have a loving Heavenly Father. As we come to know this eternal truth through mighty prayer, personal revelation, and coming unto Jesus Christ, we can now and always boldly proclaim, “I am a child of God.” In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "As I study the scriptures, I come across words that really catch my attention, primarily because they have special meaning as a result of experiences I have had during my life. I spent my career working as a forensic accountant. With that background, the word reconcile has caught my attention as I read the scriptures. My job was to reconcile reported amounts with financial records by applying accounting, auditing, and investigative skills. In other words, my goal was to align financial reports with the underlying financial documents to ensure accuracy and validity. I made diligent efforts to resolve discrepancies, and it was common that significant time was dedicated to resolving even very small discrepancies.\nThe Apostle Paul pled with the Corinthians to be “reconciled to God.” To be reconciled to God means to be brought back into harmony with God or to restore a relationship with God that has been strained or broken because of our sins or actions. Simply put, being reconciled to God means aligning our will and actions with God’s will, or as taught by President Russell M. Nelson, letting God prevail in our lives.\nAs taught in the scriptures, we are free to act for ourselves, “to choose the way of everlasting death or the way of eternal life.” But if we are not diligent, this freedom to act for ourselves may lead to a loss of alignment with the will of God.\nThe prophet Jacob taught that when we find ourselves in disharmony or misalignment with God, the only way we can achieve reconciliation is to “be reconciled unto [God] through the atonement of Christ.” We must realize that reconciliation is dependent on mercy, implying that Jesus Christ’s gracious act of atonement makes reconciliation possible.\nAs you ponder your own life, think about a time when you felt distant from Heavenly Father because you had moved away from Him. For instance, perhaps you became less diligent in your prayers to Him or in keeping His commandments. Just as we choose to distance ourselves from God, we must choose to initiate the effort to reconcile. The Lord emphasized our responsibility when He said, “Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.”\nHow does the Savior help us restore and reconcile this important relationship? For me, I make great progress in my journey to be reconciled to God when I follow the counsel taught by President Nelson and repent every day. The reason being that reconciliation signifies the restoration of a broken relationship, particularly between God and humanity, by removing the barrier of sin.\nOne of the great reconciliations we read about in the scriptures is that of Enos. Something in his life was out of alignment with God. He exemplified relying on the Atonement of Jesus Christ to reconcile with God. He explained his desire to repent, his humility, his focus, and his determination. His reconciliation with God was confirmed when a voice came to him, saying, “Enos, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed.” Enos recognized the impact that repentance and reconciliation had on him when he said, “And I, Enos, knew that God could not lie; wherefore, my guilt was swept away.”\nReconciliation brings not only relief from feelings of guilt but also peace within ourselves and with others. It heals relationships, softens hearts, and strengthens our discipleship, bringing increased confidence before God. What brings me great hope and confidence is another fruit of reconciliation described by Enos when he said, “And after I, Enos, had heard these words, my faith began to be unshaken in the Lord.”\nWhen I was a boy, my maternal grandfather had a large cherry orchard. I had the opportunity to work in the orchard, mostly in the summer during the harvest of the cherries. As a very young boy, I found that the extent of my involvement was being handed a bucket and then sent up a tree to pick the cherries.\nThe harvesting of cherries changed significantly when my grandfather purchased a machine called a cherry shaker. This machine grabs the trunk of the tree and shakes it, causing the cherries to fall out of the tree onto nets that are used to collect the cherries. I noticed that when the shaker would begin to shake the tree, almost all the cherries fell out of the tree within seconds. I also noticed that it didn’t matter if the tree was shaken for 10 seconds or a full minute, some cherries would not fall. They were truly unshakable.\nShaking cherries out of a tree is possible because of the release of ethylene. This hormone causes the layer of cells between the stem of the cherry and the tree to weaken. Therefore, the stem of a ripe cherry more easily detaches from the tree because of the weakened connection.\nIn the scriptures, we learn that the stem of Jesse is a metaphor for the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who was prophesied to come from the lineage of Jesse, the father of King David. Just as ethylene weakens the connection of a ripe cherry stem, disobedience, doubts, and fears can weaken our connection to the stem of Jesse, or Jesus Christ, allowing us to be easily shaken and separated from Him. As faithful as we may be, we must guard against a weakening of our connection to Jesus Christ.\nIn the Doctrine and Covenants, even the faithful are given a warning: “But there is a possibility that man may fall from grace and depart from the living God.” The Lord continues, “Yea, … even let those who are sanctified take heed also.” To avoid falling, the Lord counsels, “Therefore let the church take heed and pray always, lest they fall into temptation.”\nOne might equate the state of being easily shaken to what scriptures describe as being ripe for destruction, with impending consequences for actions. The phrase can also be used more broadly to indicate a state of decay, corruption, or decline that makes something susceptible to collapse or ruin.\nWhat does this ripeness represent? Does it mean that we can reach a point where we are unable to change? No, I think it means that we can reach a point in time where we are unwilling to change. The antidote to becoming ripe for destruction is to do those things that will strengthen our connection to Jesus Christ. As mentioned, repentance led Enos to the point of unshaken faith. There is strength in repentance—regular, prompt, and frequent repentance. As President Nelson taught us, “Nothing is more liberating, more ennobling, or more crucial to our individual progression than is a regular, daily focus on repentance.”\nIn addition to preaching repentance, the prophet Jacob taught that being aware of God’s hand in our lives, seeking and receiving revelation, and listening to God when He speaks all help us to not be shaken. Jacob also taught, “Wherefore, we search the prophets, and we have many revelations and the spirit of prophecy; and having all these witnesses we obtain a hope, and our faith becometh unshaken.” Listening to and acting on the words and invitations of the prophets and apostles can fill us with hope, confidence, and strength, resulting in our faith becoming unshaken.\nI have learned that a desire to be reconciled to God must be accompanied by a desire to repent. Repenting and experiencing the blessings of the Atonement of Jesus Christ lead to unshaken faith. Unshaken faith leads to a desire to always be reconciled to God. This is a circular, or iterative, pattern.\nBrothers and sisters, I invite you to be reconciled to God through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. I testify that making and keeping covenants makes our connection to the Savior strong, thereby avoiding becoming ripe for destruction. I testify that this reconciliation to God, through Jesus Christ’s Atonement, leads to unshakable faith.\nI know Heavenly Father loves you and me, and He sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to be our Savior, Redeemer, and the great Reconciler. I testify of Jesus Christ and do so in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "Last year during a trip to Europe, I visited my old place of employment, Lufthansa German Airlines at the Frankfurt Airport.\nTo train their pilots, they operate several sophisticated full-motion flight simulators that can re-create almost any normal and emergency flight condition. During my many years as an airline captain, I had to pass a check flight in the flight simulator every six months to keep my pilot license current. I remember well those intense moments of stress and anxiety but also the feeling of accomplishment after passing the test. I was young then and loved the challenge.\nDuring my visit, one of the Lufthansa executives asked if I would like to give it a try again and fly the 747 simulator one more time.\nBefore I had time to fully process the question, I heard a voice—sounding astonishingly like my own—saying, “Yes, I would like that very much.”\nAs soon as I said the words, a tsunami of thoughts flooded my mind. It had been a long time since I flew a 747. Back then I was young and a confident captain. Now I had a reputation to live up to as a former chief pilot. Would I embarrass myself in front of these professionals?\nBut it was too late to back down, so I settled into the captain’s seat, placed my hands on the familiar and beloved controls, and felt, once again, the exhilaration of flight as the big jet roared down the runway and took off into the wild blue yonder.\nI’m happy to say that the flight was successful, the aircraft remained intact, and so did my self-image.\nEven so, the experience was humbling for me. When I was in my prime, flying had become almost second nature. Now it took all my concentration to do the basic things.\n\nDiscipleship Takes Discipline\n\nMy experience in the flight simulator was an important reminder that getting good at anything—whether it be flying, rowing, sowing, or knowing—takes consistent self-discipline and practice.\nYou might spend years acquiring a skill or developing a talent. You might work so hard that it becomes second nature to you. But if you think that means you can stop practicing and studying, you’ll gradually lose the knowledge and abilities you once acquired at great cost.\nThis applies to skills like learning a language, playing a musical instrument, and flying an airliner. It also applies to becoming a disciple of Christ.\nSimply put, discipleship takes self-discipline.\nIt is not a casual endeavor, and it doesn’t happen by accident.\nFaith in Jesus Christ is a gift, but receiving it is a conscious choice that requires a commitment of all our “might, mind and strength.” It is a practice of every day. Every hour. It takes constant learning and determined commitment. Our faith, which is our loyalty to the Savior, becomes stronger as it is tested against the opposition we face here in mortality. It endures because we keep nourishing it, we keep actively applying it, and we never give up.\nOn the other hand, if we fail to use faith and its convincing power by acting upon it, we become less sure of things we once held sacred—less confident of things we once knew were true.\nTemptations that would never have enticed us begin to look less appalling and more appealing.\nThe fire of yesterday’s testimony can warm us for only so long. It needs constant nourishment to keep burning brightly.\nIn the New Testament, the Savior taught a parable about a master who gave each of his servants a sacred trust—a quantity of money called talents. The servants who diligently used their talents increased them. The servant who buried his talent eventually lost it.\nThe lesson? God gives us gifts—of knowledge, of ability, of opportunity—and He wants us to use and amplify them so they can bless us and bless His other children. That doesn’t happen if we put those gifts high on a shelf like a trophy that we admire from time to time. Our gifts magnify and multiply only when we put them to use.\n\nYou Are Gifted\n\n“But Elder Uchtdorf,” you might say, “I don’t have any gifts or talents—at least, none that are that valuable.” Perhaps you look at others whose gifts are obvious and impressive and you feel pretty ordinary by comparison. You might suppose that in the premortal existence, on the day of the great gift and talent smorgasbord, your plate seemed woefully sparse—especially compared to the stacked and overflowing plates of others.\nOh, how I wish I could embrace you and help you understand this great truth: You are a blessed being of light, the spirit child of an infinite God! And you bear within you a potential beyond your own capacity to imagine.\nAs poets have noted, you come to earth “trailing clouds of glory”!\nYour origin story is divine, and so is your destiny. You left heaven to come here, but heaven has never left you!\nYou are anything but ordinary.\nYou are gifted!\nIn the Doctrine and Covenants, God declared:\n“There are many gifts, and to every [person] is given a gift by the Spirit of God.\n“To some is given one, and to some is given another, [and] all may be profited thereby.”\nSome of our gifts are listed in the scriptures. Many are not.\nAs the prophet Moroni said, “Deny not the gifts of God, for they are many; and they come from the same God.” They might manifest themselves in “different ways … ; but it is the same God who worketh all in all.”\nIt may be true that our spiritual gifts are not always flashy, but that does not mean they are less important. May I share with you some spiritual gifts that I have noticed in so many members across the world? Contemplate whether you have been blessed with one or more gifts like:\n\nShowing compassion.\n\nNoticing people who are overlooked.\n\nFinding reasons to be joyful.\n\nBeing a peacemaker.\n\nNoticing small miracles.\n\nGiving sincere compliments.\n\nForgiving.\n\nRepenting.\n\nEnduring.\n\nExplaining things simply.\n\nConnecting with children.\n\nSustaining Church leaders.\n\nHelping others know that they belong.\n\nYou might not see these gifts displayed at the ward talent show. But I hope you can see how precious they are to the Lord’s work and how you might have touched, blessed, or even saved one of God’s children by your gifts. Remember: “By small and simple things are great things brought to pass.”\nSo let us each do our little part.\n\nDo Your Little Part\n\nMy beloved brothers and sisters, dear friends, I pray that the Spirit will help you recognize the gifts and talents God has given you. Then, let us, like the faithful servants in the Lord’s parable, increase and magnify them.\nThe day will come when we stand before our compassionate Father in Heaven to give an account of our stewardship. He will want to know what we did with the gifts He gave us—in particular, how we used them to bless His children. God knows who we truly are, who we are designed to become, and so His expectations for us are high.\nBut He doesn’t expect us to take some grand, heroic, or superhuman leap to get there. In the world He created, growth happens gradually and patiently—but also consistently and unrelentingly.\nRemember, it is Jesus Christ who already did the superhuman part when He conquered death and sin.\nOur part is to follow the Christ. It is our part to turn away from sin, turn toward the Savior, and walk in His way, one step at a time. As we do this, diligently and faithfully, we eventually cast off the shackles of imperfections and faults and slowly become refined, until that perfect day when we will be perfected in Christ.\nThe blessings are within reach. The promises are in place. The door is wide open. It is our choice to enter and begin.\nThe beginning may be small. But that is OK.\nWhere faith is weak, begin with a hope in Christ Jesus and in His power to cleanse and purify.\nOur Father asks that we approach this challenge of faith and discipleship not as casual tourists but as wholehearted believers who leave behind and abandon Babylon and set their hearts, minds, and steps toward Zion.\nWe know that our efforts alone cannot make us celestial. But they can make us loyal and committed to Jesus the Christ, and He can make us celestial.\nBecause of our beloved Savior, there is no such thing as a no-win scenario. If we place our hope and faith in Him, our victory is assured. He promises us access to His strength, His power, His abundant grace. Step by step, little by little, we will grow ever closer to that great and perfect day when we will live with Him and our loved ones in eternal glory.\nTo get there, we must do our part today and every day. We are thankful for the steps we took yesterday, but we don’t stop there. We know we still have a long way to go, but we don’t let that discourage us.\nThat is the essence of who we are—as followers of Christ.\nI urge and bless every member of the Church, and all who desire to be part of it, to trust the Savior and engage, patiently and diligently, in doing your part with all your heart—that your joy may be full and that, one day, you will receive all the Father has. Of this I bear witness in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "This general conference of October 2025 marks the 30th anniversary of the announcement of “The Family: A Proclamation to the World.” By divine design, this proclamation, with its revelatory words, was created to “maintain and strengthen the family as the fundamental unit of society.”\nEveryone belongs to a family, whether you are a mother, father, daughter, son, grandchild, grandparent, aunt, uncle, brother, sister, or cousin. Most importantly, each of us is, as the proclamation states, “a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents … [with] a divine nature and destiny.”\nWhen I was called to the holy apostleship in 2015, I was advised, “This proclamation is now yours. Your name [pointing to the words ‘Council of the Twelve Apostles’ in the title] is right here. Feel it and teach it like you own it.”\nI love the family proclamation. I have testified across the world from Africa to Australia and everywhere in between of the role of the family in God’s eternal plan. The proclamation has a divine origin, so we must treat it with the reverence deserving words from God.\nRemember, brothers and sisters, as I said in a previous general conference from this very pulpit, “Words matter.”\nLet me give you some background about the proclamation as a core message of what we believe.\nIn 1994, a year before the proclamation was presented, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles discussed how society and governments were pulling away from God’s laws for family, marriage, and gender. “But that was not the end of what we saw,” President Russell M. Nelson later explained. “We could see the efforts of various communities to do away with all standards and limitations on sexual activity. We saw the confusion of genders. We could see it all coming.”\nThe Twelve determined to prepare a document, an official proclamation, summarizing the Church’s position on family. During that year, these Apostles, seers called of God, prepared a declaration about the family. President Dallin H. Oaks recalled they prayerfully turned to the Lord for “what [they] should say and how [they] should say it.” They presented it to the First Presidency—Presidents Howard W. Hunter, Gordon B. Hinckley, and Thomas S. Monson—for their consideration.\nJust months later, in March 1995, President Hunter passed away, and President Hinckley became the 15th President of the Church. The proclamation was now in his hands. When would be the right time to make this declaration to the Church? That time came six months later.\nDays before the September 23 general Relief Society meeting that preceded general conference, President Hinckley and his counselors met in counsel with the Relief Society General Presidency. The sisters, like the Apostles, had been weighing concerns about women and families. They had focused the upcoming meeting on families.\nPresident Hinckley was scheduled to address the women at the gathering. He had been pondering the direction of his remarks. As the discussion progressed, he referred by name to the newly created but not yet public “The Family: A Proclamation to the World.” Was this women’s meeting the right setting to make the decisive declaration about family?\nRelief Society General President Elaine Jack later explained: “We didn’t know what the proclamation on the family was at that time. … [W]e could tell by the title, but we felt anything on the family … would be a positive thing. … I felt very positive that we had members of the Quorum of the Twelve that were receiving revelation.”\nThe Relief Society meeting that Saturday was historic. President Hinckley introduced the family proclamation with these important words: “With so much of sophistry that is passed off as truth, with so much of deception concerning standards and values, with so much of allurement and enticement to take on the slow stain of the world, we have felt to warn and forewarn … of standards, doctrines, and practices relative to the family which the prophets, seers, and revelators of this church have repeatedly stated throughout its history.”\nHe then read the proclamation in its entirety. As the Lord has said, “Whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.”\nThe proclamation states, “The family is ordained of God.” I love the clarity of that statement. The proclamation is a call for us to live in mortality ever mindful of the divinity within us and the eternal future that lies before us. President Nelson taught: “You are literally spirit children of God. … Make no mistake about it: Your potential is divine. With your diligent seeking, God will give you glimpses of who you may become.”\nWhen presented, the proclamation did not align with the views of many in the world. Not then. Not now. There are those who take issue with the declaration on family, marriage, and gender. Some suggest the Church pull it back, revise, or even set the proclamation aside.\nThe proclamation on the family is, as President Hinckley stated, doctrine, my dear brothers and sisters. The principles are not out of step but perfectly in step with the ways of the Lord and His covenant path. The teachings of the proclamation were revealed by our Lord Jesus Christ to His Apostles then and now. This is His Church; He has established the truths by which we live.\nSome of you may reflect on the proclamation and say, “This isn’t working for me.” “It seems insensitive.” “My family doesn’t look like that.” “I don’t fit.”\nFor those with concerns, know that you are a child of heavenly parents, part of your Heavenly Father’s family. No one knows you better or cares more deeply about you than He does. Turn to Him; pour out your heart to Him; trust Him and His promises. You have family in your Savior, Jesus Christ, who loves you. He came to earth to atone for our sins and bear the burden of our mistakes and our very bad days. He understands what you are facing and feeling. Turn to Him; trust He will send the Holy Ghost to be with you, lift you, and guide you. Feel Their love that “sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men; … it is the most desirable above all things … and the most joyous to the soul.”\nAll of the Lord’s Apostles love you dearly. We pray for you and seek the Lord’s guidance for you. Stay with us. You live in challenging times when the adversary seeks to make you his. Do not be drawn off. And if you are, come back. Our arms reach out to you, as will those of others who love you.\nThe proclamation states, “Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness.” The Book of Mormon provides a second witness to this truth. In the first verse of the first chapter, we read, “I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents.” How many of us have started the Book of Mormon—and started again and again—and in the process committed those words to memory? Commit them to heart.\nOne of my favorite statements in the proclamation is this: “Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of … Jesus Christ.”\nWho does not want to be happy?\nAnd what are the teachings of Jesus Christ? Again, in the proclamation: “Faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities.”\nWhose life will not be better by applying these key principles? None of us are going to do perfectly; but we can follow President Hinckley’s wise words: “Do the very best you can.”\nWe read in the proclamation, “Fathers are to preside … in love and righteousness,” and “mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children.” Preside does not mean dominate, and nurture does not mean a secondary role. God has given men and women different but equal and essential roles that complement each other.\nLet me share a personal story.\nMy wife and I learned to work better at being equal partners after one day when I decided to make an important decision without consulting her. My action surprised her, took her off guard, and put her in a very difficult situation. Afterward, she put her hands on my shoulders and firmly said, “Ron, please, never do that to me again.” We have pretty much been on the same page ever since.\nWe find in the family proclamation: “Fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners.”\nEqual is a word that matters. Over the years, as Sister Rasband and I have worked together in what the proclamation describes as our “sacred responsibilities,” we have shaped an equally yoked marriage. As each of our children is now married, Sister Rasband and I have continued to counsel them and their spouses on how to be equal partners.\nWhen we live with our eyes single to the glory of God, we respect one another and support one another. Those divine patterns of righteousness lead to stability in our individual lives, our families, and society.\nOur Father in Heaven has provided the proclamation on the family to help guide us home to Him, to help us learn and be filled with love, strength, purpose, and eternal understanding. With all my soul, I plead with you to live close to Him and His Beloved Son. I promise as you do so, the Spirit will inspire and guide you and help you feel in your heart Their promised peace that “passeth all understanding.” In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "A story is told of a young university student who struggled with a challenging class, so he hired a tutor to help him. Near the end of the course, the professor announced that students could bring to the final exam one piece of paper on which they could place anything they wanted. Some students prepared by making tiny notes with information from lectures and textbooks, readable only by using a magnifying glass. But the young man arrived at the final exam with a blank sheet of paper and a stranger. When the professor questioned him, the young man replied, “You said I could bring one piece of paper with anything on it.” He then placed the paper on the floor next to his desk and said, “I’d like my tutor to stand on my piece of paper.”\n\nThe Holy Ghost\n\nAs members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, blessed with the companionship of a member of the Godhead, we can have the help of the perfect Tutor. The Holy Ghost knows all things, testifies of truth, and will “bring all things to [our] remembrance.” President Russell M. Nelson frequently spoke about the importance of hearing the voice of the Lord. He taught us how to invite the guidance of the Holy Ghost and repeatedly pleaded with us to increase our spiritual capacity to receive revelation.\nToday I invite you to consider the role of the Holy Ghost, specifically related to gospel learning and teaching in the home and at church. The Holy Ghost is given by the prayer of faith and as we strive to live worthy of this precious gift. The inspired Church manual outlines additional principles the Lord has established that will help invite the influence of the Holy Ghost.\n\nInvite Diligent Learning\n\nOne of these principles is to invite diligent learning. In the past, we may have thought of teaching as a chance for a parent or teacher to invite the Spirit into their own preparation and then share what they have learned with children or class members, whose role it has been to listen. But even more effective is when we, as learners, also come prepared and when teachers create learning experiences that foster personal revelation directly to our hearts and minds. Then, as we’re given opportunities to share what we are learning through our study and from the Holy Ghost, we help each other to be instructed and edified. As we apply gospel principles, the Spirit again bears witness of their truthfulness.\n\nAs in all things, Jesus Christ is the perfect example. He has invited each of us to be diligent learners and to take charge of our own testimonies. He invited His disciples to prepare to learn, to share what they were learning, and to act in faith. He prayed for them, saw their divine potential, listened to them, and helped them know they were loved and needed.\nAs teachers, we can focus more on the learner’s progress, on meeting their needs, and on helping them to develop spiritual habits of lifelong discipleship. As learners, when we exercise our agency in the learning process, we signal to the Holy Ghost our willingness to be taught by Him.\nI’m grateful for a teacher who invited me to be a better learner. When I began college, I mistakenly thought of school as something to endure in order to be allowed to play sports. One day, after reading a paper I had written, my professor told me she thought I was a gifted analytical thinker. I didn’t even know what that meant. She said that with more focused effort, I could be a good student. That thought had never crossed my mind. Her interest, encouragement, and invitations changed the course of my education and greatly blessed my life.\n\nTeach the Doctrine\n\nAnother principle relevant to inviting the Holy Ghost is to teach true doctrine. This means that our gospel study and instruction are rooted in the word of God and that we don’t sensationalize or speculate on what the Lord has not revealed. Instead, we focus on essential and eternal gospel principles, which allows the Spirit to testify of truth. Again, we follow the example of the Savior. He said, “My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.”\nTrue doctrine is found in the scriptures and teachings of modern prophets. The Lord’s exhortation to study the scriptures individually and as families and to attend church each week to study His gospel provides a remarkable framework to learn His doctrine and hear His voice. We search the scriptures to understand the narrative, the principles they teach, and the application of these truths in our lives. What a blessing it is to have the scriptures at our fingertips. Imagine Adam and Eve, Abinadi, or even the Master Teacher, Jesus Christ, visiting our homes or classes to teach us. They can when we feast upon the word of God. With consistent effort, we can learn to understand and love the scriptures and trust that they have the answers to the questions of the soul.\nThere was a time before we were married when my wife, Kristi, was struggling to feel Heavenly Father’s love and to understand His plan for her. As she prayed for guidance, an impression came that she should attend institute, so she enrolled in a New Testament class. The way her institute teacher taught from the scriptures, even the way he held them, showed how much he loved the word of God. As she attended, the Holy Ghost whispered to her that there was something in the scriptures that she needed. Her teacher’s love for the scriptures and the promptings of the Holy Ghost gave her a desire to begin a serious study of the word of God—which became a lifelong journey of deep conversion and consecrated service.\n\nFocus on Jesus Christ\n\nFinally, as suggests, our teaching and learning should always focus on Jesus Christ. We can speak more often and more reverently of Him and seek more opportunities to express testimony, gratitude, and love for Him. Whatever the setting, as we remember Him, we can have “his Spirit to be with [us].”\nOne way to place Jesus Christ at the center of our teaching is to emphasize that He is the perfect example, the embodiment and expression of all gospel principles. Even when He is not directly referred to in a scriptural account, we can still point to Him as the example of the principle being taught. We might simply ask, “Can you think of a time when Jesus Christ exemplified this principle?”\nWe can also focus on Him by learning of His titles, roles, and attributes, seeking not only to learn what He has done but also to better understand who He is. For example, when studying the principle of repentance, it’s important to understand how to repent. But it’s also essential to remember what Jesus Christ has done to make repentance possible and to understand what repentance teaches us about Him, about His true nature and characteristics. What does our opportunity to repent say about His love, patience, and mercy, His belief in our divine potential, His willingness to atone for our sins, and the joy He finds in forgiving? And understanding His titles—such as Lamb of God, Redeemer, and Physician—helps us see that repentance is His invitation to cleanse, change, and heal us. Focusing on what He has done for us and what it says about who He is can help us have “faith unto repentance.”\nAt times, we may not immediately see the attributes of the Savior outlined in a scriptural account. For example, when reading about Nephi building a boat, we might focus only on Nephi. But focusing on the Savior can help us see that this record was not preserved to teach us about the greatness of Nephi but to show us the greatness of God—that He gives us strength to keep His commandments and delivers us in times of need.\nWe can also focus on Jesus Christ’s central role in Heavenly Father’s perfect plan of happiness. It can change the course of our lives to see our circumstances through the lens of God’s eternal plan instead of seeing the plan through the lens of our temporal circumstances. The gospel is not a list of demands; it’s the good news that Jesus Christ overcame sin and death. It is by accessing His amazing grace through keeping our covenants with God that we can live joyfully now and prepare for life with our Father in Heaven in the eternities. As we learn to see Heavenly Father and the Savior in the scriptures, we will come to know Them better and we will see Their love and influence more frequently and more powerfully in our own lives.\nI will always remember the Spirit I felt as a youth when our teacher taught about the final days of the Savior’s life. He helped us see the significance of the events in the upper room, Gethsemane, Golgotha, and the empty tomb. He shared his profound gratitude for the Savior and his consuming desire to follow Him. His teaching was an invitation for the Holy Ghost to testify of Jesus Christ. And the Spirit I felt in that class deepened my faith and increased my love and appreciation for the Savior. The influence of that teacher has stayed with me my entire life. As was said of another teacher, “We could warm our hands by the fire of his faith.”\n\nConclusion\n\nIn our homes and Church meetings, as we focus on Jesus Christ, teach His doctrine, and learn diligently, we invite the Holy Ghost to deepen our faith in Jesus Christ and help us become more like Him, which is the aim of all gospel teaching and learning.\n\nI’m grateful for the teachers in my life, from goodly parents and local leaders and teachers to the men and women who have been called to teach and testify from this pulpit, who help us to know and follow Jesus Christ. And I’m grateful for the Holy Ghost, the perfect Tutor. It is through the Holy Ghost that I know that Heavenly Father loves us and has a perfect plan for us; that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior and Redeemer of the world; and that His gospel and Church have been restored. I gratefully testify of these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "Thank you, choir, for your testimony through that new hymn.\nThe new sacrament hymn “Bread of Life, Living Water” fills my soul. One line in the hymn says, “Now I come before the altar, off’ring Him my broken heart.”\nMy understanding of those words deepened soon after our family departed Newbury Park, California, to serve in the Utah Ogden Mission in 2015. I received an invitation to tour Hill Air Force Base near Layton, Utah. I had never been on a military base, nor had I met a military chaplain or the men and women who work to provide safety and protection for their country.\nChaplain Harp, like thousands of other volunteer and professional chaplains who serve in our prisons, hospitals, and military installations around the world, inspired and uplifted me. Our last stop on the base was the sanctuary. I asked the chaplain if he administered services for all people who desired to ponder, pray, meditate, and worship. He went to the front wall of the chapel, and he pulled a cross from behind the curtains. He said he used the cross for Protestant and Catholic services. I asked what he used for our Jewish brothers and sisters, and he went to the other side of the front wall, and he pulled out a Star of David.\nI then asked, “What do you do for Latter-day Saint services?” He pushed those symbols away and pointed to the large wooden altar in the middle of the sanctuary. He said that members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints prepare and bless the bread and water on the altar. I asked if the large, seemingly fixed altar was removed before the services of our Jewish, Muslim, Catholic, or Protestant brothers and sisters. He said that the altar stays in place, for several of those faiths also utilize the altar in some way.\nAbraham built an altar, bound Isaac, and was ready to sacrifice his only son, but his hand was stayed, and he declared, like the Lord has declared, “Here am I”! How many times has the Great I Am or one of His prophets volunteered, “Here am I”?\nDuring His Sermon on the Mount, the Savior invited us to reconcile with our brothers and sisters before we approach the altar. Paul taught that we are “sanctified” at the altar through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\nThe prophet Lehi “left his house … and his precious things. … [Then] he built an altar …⁠ and made an offering … , and gave thanks unto the Lord.”\nThe Bible and the Book of Mormon teach us to worship the Son of God at altars. Why?\nOur first parents, Adam and Eve, built and worshipped at altars. After they were cast out of the Garden of Eden and had worshipped for “many days,” an angel visited and asked a poignant question that could be asked of each of us: “Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord?”\nAdam answered, “I know not.”\nThe angel’s response to Adam’s humble admission is stunning: “This … is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father. … Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son, and thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore.”\nThe sacrament table and temple altars symbolize the sacrifice of Jesus Christ and His infinite Atonement.\nAs we make and honor our covenants, receiving the ordinances of the sacrament at church and the endowment and sealing at the temple, we bind ourselves to the Savior, gaining greater access to His mercy, protection, sanctification, healing, and rest.\n\nMercy and Protection Through Covenants\n\nAs a 15-year-old young man, I asked my dad if I could skip sacrament meeting—just one Sunday in January for a special American football game. He said I was old enough to make that choice for myself and asked me to consider one piece of counsel. He said, “If you choose to miss the sacrament once, it’s much easier to choose to miss it again.”\nIf the Savior is the great connector, then the adversary is the separator. He, Satan, tempts us to separate ourselves from our consecrated places of worship and from the protection of Jesus Christ. When we worship the Savior, we receive “power to go against the natural worldly flow.” When we spend time in communion with Him, we have a promise to be “delivered from Satan.” “Then, as we keep our covenants, He endows us with His … strengthening power.” Oh, how I cherish the experience of communing with the Savior through covenants made at holy altars.\nBuilding an understanding of the Savior’s eternal Atonement line upon line, precept upon precept, provides a spiritual inoculation against the wiles of the adversary. Young Elder Jaggi in Mexico, Zuster Jaggi in Belgium, and other missionaries throughout the world are much more likely to see their friends claim the blessings of baptism and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost if their friends attend sacrament meeting within the first week of contact.\nA young adult in Tonga or Samoa is much more likely to be sealed in the house of the Lord if they have prepared for and received their endowment soon after graduating from school. In the endowment, members are invited to live, obey, and keep five laws which imbue their lives with power and protection. As we make covenants with the Lord, a reciprocal relationship forms. We demonstrate our loyalty and love to Him. Our strength and power grow with each promise made and kept.\n\nReflection and Sanctification\n\nWhen we humbly and symbolically kneel at the altars of the Lord, it is an opportunity for reflection, “checked as to the pride of [our] hearts, … [humbling ourselves] before God.” Before I went out with my friends as a youth, my mother would often say, “Remember who you are, and check in when you get home.” Some nights I missed my check-in because I arrived home too late. I regret missing those important visits with Mom.\nToday I look forward to check-in connections with Heavenly Father. In my daily pattern of personal worship, I kneel in prayer, next to my bed or gathered with family, and I envision myself kneeling at the altars, reflecting on and examining my life. I think about the sacrament, even whole pieces of bread, broken and torn for us, each a symbol of our Savior’s broken body. I’m reminded of President Dallin H. Oaks’s teaching that “each piece of bread is unique, just as the individuals who partake of it are unique.” When I kneel in prayer, I think on how I can give God my will.\nElder David A. Bednar taught that “the ordinance of the sacrament is a holy and repeated invitation to repent sincerely and to be renewed spiritually. The act of partaking of the sacrament, in and of itself, does not remit sins. But as we prepare conscientiously and participate in this holy ordinance with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, then the promise is that we may always have the Spirit of the Lord to be with us. And by the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost as our constant companion, we can always retain a remission of our sins.”\nWhen Amy and I look closely at our life experiences, we celebrate the gift of Jesus Christ’s perfect love and sacrifice. We also see how hell’s fury has been loosed. How can we overcome stares of judgment, anxiety, depression, cancer, diabetes, online bullying, stolen identity, lost pregnancies, the loss of a child, a brother, and a father? Because Jesus took of the bitter cup of trembling, the cup of fury—for me, for my family, for all of us!The “bitter cup” He drank in the Garden of Gethsemane and His suffering, “intensified” on the cross at Calvary, allow us to lay the hard, the insolent, the violent, the furious, and the trembling upon the altars of the Lord and be “sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost,” always.\nSister Patricia Holland said, “My deepest prayer for you and for myself today is that we will give over completely, lay ourselves at the altar of God’s promises and peace no matter where we are and no matter what we have done.”\n\nA Place of Healing and Rest\n\nWhen we come to the altar, we aren’t earning a reward; we are learning about the Gift Giver. In that learning and covenant binding comes healing. Nephi said, “He hath filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of my flesh.” And our loving Savior invited, “Will ye not now return unto me, and repent of your sins, and be converted, that I may heal you?”\nWhen our two oldest daughters, Mackenzie and Emma, were little, one of their favorite stories was. We all fell in love with the lion, Aslan. One of our most memorable nights reading the book was when the great lion gave his life for Edmund. Memorable because parents and daughters shed tears as the lion’s life was taken on the Stone Table by the Witch. Memorable because hope persisted, despite the tragedy, until the spectacular happened. Squeals of joy resounded in that little bedroom when Aslan was resurrected and said, “If [the Witch knew the true meaning of sacrifice], … she would [know] that [if] a willing victim who had committed no treachery [died] in a traitor’s stead, the [Stone] Table would crack and Death itself would [begin to unwind].”\nJesus Christ heals all wounds. Jesus Christ makes it possible to live again.\nIn his October 2022 general conference talk, President Russell M. Nelson described a tour group coming through a temple open house. A young boy was there. President Nelson taught:\n“When the tour group entered an endowment room, the boy pointed to the altar, where people kneel to make covenants with God, and said, ‘Oh, that’s nice. Here is a place for people to rest on their temple journey.’\n“… He likely had no idea about the direct connection between making a covenant with God in the temple and the Savior’s stunning promise:\n“‘Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest⁠.\n“‘Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; … and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\n“‘For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light’ [Matthew 11:28–30; emphasis added].”\n“The Son of Man has no place to lay his head,” yet He invited His disciples, you and me, to the sacrament table to rest with Him there. When “humble souls at altars kneel,” peace abounds. Our Savior’s arms are outstretched; His table is spread. Come worship the Son of God at His holy altars. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "My dear brothers and sisters, lately I have been reflecting on three powerful truths from the Restoration. These truths have profoundly blessed my life. Today, I would like to share with you how these truths have guided me on my journey toward a sure witness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\n1. God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father\n\nHe is omniscient and omnipotent. Through the Light of Christ and the ministration of the Holy Ghost, His influence is everywhere. It is in His nature to bless us.\nHe sees our past, present, and eternal destiny. Nothing can be hidden from Him.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson’s invitation to “think celestial” encourages us to emulate our Heavenly Father’s vision and nature.\nBecause of His divine attributes, our Heavenly Father gives us every good gift, each with His eternal perspective and vision in mind.\n\n2. Agency Is the Gift to Choose and Act for Ourselves\n\nIt is also the responsibility to choose well.\nJesus Christ paid the ultimate price for that privilege with His precious blood.\nSometimes we might believe that agency means doing whatever we want. But the fact that the price was paid means agency is a sacred gift.\nWe are agents, and agents are responsible for something. In this case, we are responsible for the choices we make based on the knowledge we have and the gifts we are given. We cannot make a choice without being responsible for the consequences.\nWhy do we have agency?\nTo choose good.\nTo choose Christ.\nTo choose eternal life—again and again.\n\n3. Our Testimony Comes Through the Power of the Holy Ghost\n\nA witness from the Holy Ghost is greater than sight. He is the preeminent witness of the Father and the Son. President Nelson taught, “In coming days, it will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding, directing, comforting, and constant influence of the Holy Ghost.”\nBrothers and sisters, this is why we each need the power of the Holy Ghost today.\nA testimony through the Holy Ghost can come in many ways. Like a light bulb in a dark room, it can come on dramatically and suddenly. It can come like the sunrise gradually and over time. It can come like rays of light, intermittent exposure to pure intelligence. Whatever the way, it comes through the Holy Ghost.\n\nFinding Testimony in Jamaica\n\nI grew up in beautiful Jamaica; it was fun and wonderful. However, when I started high school, some classmates and friends could not understand my decision to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ. “How could you join that church?” they would ask. “How could you believe that story?”—referring to the First Vision. “How could you read that book?”—referring to the Book of Mormon. “Do you really believe all that?” And “Why are you wasting your life away?”\n\nIt was painful, especially when it came from people I cared about.\nBut what they didn’t know was this: I had an experience with the Holy Ghost. As that testimony filled my heart, it dulled the pain of days, and “for one brief moment, heaven’s view [appeared] before my gaze.”\nPerhaps you have been asked some of these questions. Perhaps even now you are being bombarded as I was.\nThe gift and witness of the Holy Ghost are available to everyone.\nJamaica is to me like Palmyra was to Joseph Smith. It is my Sacred Grove. I do not know the exact spot where Joseph knelt to pray in the Sacred Grove, but I know exactly where I was when my Sacred Grove became a reality. It happened at Four Grove Road, Mandeville, Jamaica, in my bathroom, at 6:00 a.m. on a Wednesday three years after my baptism. This sacred experience happened because two weeks earlier an inspired sister missionary invited me to read the Book of Mormon. Sister Audrey Krauss is attending this conference today with her family, and I forever love her.\n\nThat experience changed me.\nBrothers and sisters, a testimony is not given for temporary use. This gift from our loving Heavenly Father is meant to be eternal because the giver is eternal. A testimony should not have an expiration date. It should not weaken or diminish because something in my life has changed or something in the world has changed. It should get stronger because, like the servant’s talents in the parable of the talents, my personal testimony is a gift to be multiplied—not buried.\nLooking back on those difficult days of testing and persecution that I went through as a child has helped me get to the place where I now know for myself. I not only believe, hope, or trust, even though these are significant particles of faith on the pathway to a sure witness. I commend you for making your own way by asking questions, studying, praying, fasting, and pondering. Please don’t stop. It is worth every effort to pursue this path to testimony. Who or what will you allow to take that away? “What greater witness can you have than from God?”\nEvery son or daughter of God can gain a deeper, firmer, and surer knowledge for themselves. Like Joseph Smith, who affirmed his testimony despite opposition, we can boldly say, “I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it.”\nMy dear brothers and sisters, let the small seedling of testimony work in you until it springs up to an everlastingly glorious sure knowledge.\nIf you are a baptized and confirmed member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints but still struggle with “I am not sure if I know,” please remember this promise in the sacrament prayer: “That they may always have his Spirit to be with them.” Because of this promise, each of us can pursue the path to testimony and a sure knowledge.\n\nTake Charge of Your Testimony\n\nNow here is a grand truth: In whatever way a testimony is given—whether it is distilled like the sunrise or comes in a glorious vision—it still requires a choice to receive this precious gift.\nSaying “I choose to believe” makes it easier to receive a witness from God. If we find our testimony weakening, remember that it is the choices we make that diminish the power of the testimony. But the testimony has not gone anywhere. We just need to choose to reconnect with it.\nChoosing to believe is a wise and powerful way to use our agency.\nI cannot see a better way to use my agency than in defense of my testimony.\nPresident Nelson taught: “I plead with you to take charge of your testimony. Work for it. Own it. Care for it. Nurture it so that it will grow. Feed it truth.”\nTo me, the words take charge, work, care, own, nurture, and feed sound like an agent given stewardship for something precious and important.\nIn the early Church, Parley P. Pratt felt disgruntled with the Prophet Joseph Smith and chose to criticize him and the Church. When John Taylor, whom Parley taught the gospel, came to town, Parley took him aside and warned him not to follow Joseph. John Taylor said to Parley:\n“Before you left Canada, you bore a strong testimony to Joseph Smith being a prophet of God, … and you said you knew these things by revelation and the gift of the Holy Ghost.\n“… I now have the same testimony that you then rejoiced in. If the work was true six months ago, it is true today. If Joseph Smith was then a prophet, he is now a prophet.”\nI testify that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God and that the prophetic mantle he received continues today. Jesus Christ directs this work.\nI invite you to think about your path to a sure witness of Jesus Christ and His gospel. Take charge of your testimony; use your agency wisely and acknowledge the giver and all His glorious attributes. I bear witness that the power is within you. No one can choose for you. No one can take this gift away. You can choose to believe.\nI promise that as you do this, your testimony will be a “well of living water, springing up unto everlasting life.” It will be an anchor and a motivator, and it will sustain you through difficult times. It will enable you to develop spiritual gifts. It will help you in your personal ministry and service. It will be a weapon against Satan and your adversaries. Your testimony will be a joy as you see it replicated in your children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren and in those you love and serve. It will be powerful when you share it and use it to testify.\nIf you know, you know. I know that I know. We need more sure witnesses of Jesus Christ and His gospel. Get there! Seek it! It is urgent! This is the final dispensation—the dispensation of the fulness of times.\nJesus Christ declared this truth: “Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.”\nBrothers and sisters, a testimony of Jesus Christ was never meant to be a temporary gift. Nothing about it is temporary—not the giver, not the gift itself, not the deliverer of the gift, not who the gift is about. May your testimony be described in this same way. Though “heaven and earth shall pass away,” your testimony and witness of the gospel of Jesus Christ will not pass away. Now is the time to lay hold on this precious gift. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "I.\n\nFor 50 years, I have studied culture, including gospel culture. I began with fortune cookies.\nIn San Francisco’s Chinatown, Gong family dinners concluded with a fortune cookie and a wise saying like “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.”\n\nAs a young adult, I made fortune cookies. Wearing white cotton gloves, I folded and tucked into shape the round cookies hot out of the oven.\n\nTo my surprise, I learned fortune cookies are not originally part of Chinese culture. To distinguish Chinese, American, and European fortune cookie culture, I looked for fortune cookies on multiple continents—just as one would use multiple locations to triangulate a forest fire. Chinese restaurants in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York serve fortune cookies, but not those in Beijing, London, or Sydney. Only Americans celebrate National Fortune Cookie Day. Only Chinese advertisements offer “Authentic American Fortune Cookies.”\nFortune cookies are a fun, simple example. But the same principle of comparing practices in different cultural settings can help us distinguish gospel culture. And now the Lord is opening new opportunities to learn gospel culture as Book of Mormon allegory and New Testament parable prophecies are fulfilled.\n\nII.\n\nEverywhere people are moving. The United Nations reports 281 million international migrants. This is 128 million more individuals than in 1990 and more than three times 1970 estimates. Everywhere, record numbers of converts are finding The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Every Sabbath, members and friends from 195 birth countries and territories gather in 31,916 Church congregations. We speak 125 languages.\n\nRecently, in Albania, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Switzerland, and Germany, I witnessed new members fulfilling the Book of Mormon allegory of the olive tree. In Jacob 5, the Lord of the vineyard and his servants strengthen both olive tree roots and branches by gathering and grafting together those from diverse locations. Today children of God gather as one in Jesus Christ; the Lord offers a remarkable natural means to expand our lived fulness of His restored gospel.\nPreparing us for the kingdom of heaven, Jesus tells the parables of the great supper and wedding feast. In these parables, invited guests make excuses not to come. The master instructs his servants to “go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city” and “the highways and hedges” to “bring in hither” the poor, maimed, halt, and blind. Spiritually speaking, that’s each of us.\nScripture declares:\n“All nations shall be invited” unto “a supper of the house of the Lord.”\n“Prepare ye the way of the Lord, … that his kingdom may go forth upon the earth, that the inhabitants thereof may receive it, and be prepared for the days to come.”\nToday those invited to the supper of the Lord come from every place and culture. Old and young, rich and poor, local and global, we make our Church congregations look like our communities.\nAs chief Apostle, Peter saw heaven open a vision of “a great sheet knit at the four corners, … wherein were all manner of … beasts.” Taught Peter: “Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons. … In every nation he that feareth [the Lord], and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.”\n\nIn the parable of the good Samaritan, Jesus invites us to come to each other and to Him in His inn—His Church. He invites us to be good neighbors. The good Samaritan promises to return and recompense the care of those in His inn. Living the gospel of Jesus Christ includes making room for all in His restored Church.\nThe spirit of “room in the inn” includes “no one sits alone.” When you come to church, if you see someone alone, will you please say hello and sit with him or her? This may not be your custom. The person may look or speak differently than you. And of course, as a fortune cookie might say, “A journey of gospel friendship and love begins with a first hello and no one sitting alone.”\n“No one sits alone” also means no one sits alone emotionally or spiritually. I went with a brokenhearted father to visit his son. Years earlier, the son was excited to become a new deacon. The occasion included his family buying him his first pair of new shoes.\nBut at church, the deacons laughed at him. His shoes were new, but not fashionable. Embarrassed and hurt, the young deacon said he would never go again to church. My heart is still broken for him and his family.\nOn the dusty roads to Jericho, each of us has been laughed at, embarrassed and hurt, perhaps scorned or abused. And with varying degrees of intent, each of us has also disregarded, not seen or heard, perhaps deliberately hurt others. It is precisely because we have been hurt and have hurt others that Jesus Christ brings us all to His inn. In His Church and through His ordinances and covenants, we come to each other and to Jesus Christ. We love and are loved, serve and are served, forgive and are forgiven. Please remember, “earth has no sorrow that heav’n cannot heal”; earth burdens lighten—our Savior’s joy is real.\nIn 1 Nephi 19, we read: “Even the very God of Israel do [they] trample under their feet; … they set him at naught. … Wherefore they scourge him, and he suffereth it; and they smite him, and he suffereth it. Yea, they spit upon him, and he suffereth it.”\nMy friend Professor Terry Warner says the judging, scourging, smiting, and spitting were not occasional events that occurred only during Christ’s mortal life. How we treat each other—especially the hungry, the thirsty, those left out alone—is how we treat Him.\nIn His restored Church, we are all better when no one sits alone. Let us not simply accommodate or tolerate. Let us genuinely welcome, acknowledge, minister to, love. May each friend, sister, brother not be a foreigner or stranger but a child at home.\n\nToday many feel lonely and isolated. Social media and artificial intelligence can leave us yearning for human closeness and human touch. We want to hear each other’s voices. We want authentic belonging and kindness.\n\nThere are many reasons we may feel we do not fit in at church—that, speaking figuratively, we sit alone. We may worry about our accent, clothes, family situation. Perhaps we feel inadequate, smell of smoke, yearn for moral cleanliness, have broken up with someone and feel hurt and embarrassed, are concerned about this or that Church policy. We may be single, divorced, widowed. Our children are noisy; we don’t have children. We didn’t serve a mission or came home early. The list goes on.\nMosiah 18:21 invites us to knit our hearts together in love. I invite us to worry less, judge less, be less demanding of others—and, when needed, be less hard on ourselves. We do not create Zion in a day. But each “hello,” each warm gesture, brings Zion closer. Let us trust the Lord more and choose joyfully to obey all His commandments.\n\nIII.\n\nDoctrinally, in the household of faith and fellowship of the Saints, no one sits alone because of covenant belonging in Jesus Christ.\nTaught the Prophet Joseph Smith: “It is left for us to see, participate in and help to roll forward the Latter-day glory, ‘the dispensation of the fullness of times … ,’ when the Saints of God will be gathered in one from every nation, and kindred, and people.”\nGod “doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world; … that he may draw all men [and women] unto him. …\n“… He inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; … and all are alike unto God.”\nConversion in Jesus Christ requires us to put off the natural man and worldly culture. As President Dallin H. Oaks teaches, we are to give up any tradition and cultural practice that is contrary to the commandments of God and to become Latter-day Saints. He explains, “There is a unique gospel culture, a set of values and expectations and practices common to all [the] members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.” Gospel culture includes chastity, weekly attendance at church, abstaining from alcohol, tobacco, tea, and coffee. It includes honesty and integrity, understanding we move forward, not upward or downward, in Church positions.\nI learn from faithful members and friends in every land and culture. Scriptures studied in multiple languages and cultural perspectives deepen gospel understanding. Different expressions of Christlike attributes deepen my love and understanding of my Savior. All are blessed when we define our cultural identity, as President Russell M. Nelson taught, as a child of God, a child of the covenant, a disciple of Jesus Christ.\nThe peace of Jesus Christ is meant for us personally. Recently a young man earnestly asked, “Elder Gong, can I still go to heaven?” He wondered if he could ever be forgiven. I asked his name, listened carefully, invited him to talk with his bishop, gave him a big hug. He left with hope in Jesus Christ.\nI mentioned the young man in another setting. Later I received an unsigned letter that began, “Elder Gong, my wife and I have raised nine kids … and served two missions.” But “I always felt I would not be allowed in the celestial kingdom … because my sins as a youth were so bad!”\nThe letter continued, “Elder Gong, when you told about the young man gaining hope of forgiveness, I was filled with joy, beginning to realize that maybe I [could be forgiven].” The letter concludes, “I even like myself now!”\nCovenant belonging deepens as we come to each other and to the Lord in His inn. The Lord blesses us all when no one sits alone. And who knows? Maybe the person we sit next to may become our best fortune cookie friend. May we find and make place for Him and each other at the supper of the Lamb, I humbly pray in the holy name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "1. Introduction\n\nThirty-three years ago, I received my call to serve as a missionary in the Utah Ogden Mission. Of course, because I was coming from Europe, some local Utah traditions like “green Jell-O with carrots” and “funeral potatoes” were a bit peculiar to me!\nHowever, I was deeply impressed by the devotion and discipleship of many of the Saints, the sheer number of people attending Church meetings, and the scale of fully functioning Church programs. When my mission came to an end, I wanted to make sure that the joy I felt and the spiritual strength and maturity I observed would also be available for my future family. I was determined to return quickly to live my life in the “shadows of the everlasting hills.”\nHowever, the Lord had different plans. On my first Sunday at home, my wise bishop called me to serve as the Young Men president in our ward. Serving this wonderful group of young men, I quickly learned that the joy that comes from being a disciple of Christ has very little to do with the size of Church meetings or the scale of programs.\nSo when I married my beautiful wife, Margret, we joyfully decided to stay in Europe and raise our family in our home country of Germany. Together we witnessed what President Russell M. Nelson taught many years ago: “The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives.” When the focus of our life is on Christ and His gospel message, we can experience the full blessings of discipleship wherever we live.\n\n2. The Simplicity That Is in Christ\n\nHowever, in a world that is increasingly secular, complex, and confusing, with different and often conflicting messages and demands, how can we avoid our eyes becoming blinded and our hearts becoming hardened and remain focused on the “plain and precious things” of the gospel of Jesus Christ? During a time of confusion, the Apostle Paul gave great advice to the Saints of Corinth by reminding them to focus on “the simplicity that is in Christ.”\nThe doctrine of Christ and the law of the gospel are so simple that even little children can understand them. We can access the redeeming power of Jesus Christ and receive all the spiritual blessings our Heavenly Father has prepared for us by exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, being baptized, being sanctified through the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. President Nelson described this journey so beautifully as the “covenant path” and the process of becoming a “devout disciple of Jesus Christ.”\nIf this message is so simple, why does it often feel so challenging to live Christ’s law and follow His example? It may be that we misinterpret simplicity as something that is easy to achieve without effort or diligence. Following Christ requires constant effort and continual change. We need to “[put] off the natural man and … [become like a little] child.” This includes putting our “trust in the Lord” and letting the complexity go, just as little children do. Applying the doctrine of Christ in a simplified and focused way will help us to find joy in our daily lives, give guidance in our callings, answer some of life’s most complex questions, and provide strength to face our greatest challenges.\nBut how can we practically implement this simplicity in our lifelong journey as disciples of Christ? President Nelson reminded us to focus on “pure truth, pure doctrine, and pure revelation” as we seek to follow the Savior. Regularly asking, “What would the Lord Jesus Christ have me do?” reveals profound direction. Following His example provides a safe path through uncertainty and a loving, guiding hand to hold from day to day. He is the Prince of Peace and the Good Shepherd. He is our Comforter and Deliverer. He is our Rock and Refuge. He is a Friend—your friend and my friend! He invites us all to love God, keep His commandments, and love our neighbor.\nAs we choose to follow His example and move forward with faith in Christ, embrace the power of His Atonement, and remember our covenants, love fills our hearts, hope and healing raise our spirits, and bitterness and sorrow are replaced by gratitude and the patience to wait for promised blessings. At times, we may need to distance ourselves from an unhealthy situation or seek professional help. But in every case, applying simple gospel principles will help us navigate through life’s challenges in the Lord’s way.\nWe sometimes underestimate the strength we receive from simple acts like prayer, fasting, scripture study, daily repentance, partaking of the sacrament weekly, and regular worship in the house of the Lord. But when we recognize that we don’t need to “do some great thing” and we center ourselves on applying pure and simple doctrine, we start to see how the gospel “works wonderfully” for us, even in the most challenging circumstances. We find strength and “confidence before God,” even when we experience heartache. Elder M. Russell Ballard has reminded us many times, “It is in that simplicity that [we] will find … peace, joy, and happiness.”\nApplying the simplicity that is in Christ makes us prioritize people over processes and eternal relationships over short-term behaviors. We focus on “the things that matter most” in God’s work of salvation and exaltation instead of getting caught up in managing our ministering. We make ourselves free to prioritize the things we can do rather than being weighed down by the things we cannot do. The Lord reminded us: “Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great.” What powerful encouragement to act in simplicity and humility, whatever our circumstances are.\n\n3. Oma Cziesla\n\nMy grandmother Marta Cziesla was a wonderful example of doing “small and simple things” to bring great things to pass. We lovingly called her Oma Cziesla. Oma embraced the gospel in the small village of Selbongen in East Prussia together with my great-grandmother on May 30, 1926.\n\nShe loved the Lord and His gospel and was determined to keep the covenants she had made. In 1930 she married my grandfather, who was not a member of the Church. At this point it became impossible for Oma to attend Church meetings because my grandfather’s farm was far away from the nearest congregation. But she focused on what she could do. Oma continued to pray, read the scriptures, and sing the songs of Zion.\nSome people might have thought she was no longer active in her faith, but that was far from the truth. When my aunt and my father were born, with no priesthood in the home and no Church meetings or access to ordinances nearby, she again did what she could do and focused on teaching her children “to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord.” She read to them from the scriptures, sang with them the songs of Zion, and of course prayed with them—every day. A 100 percent home-centered Church experience.\nIn 1945 my grandfather was serving in the war far away from home. When enemies approached their farm, Oma took her two little children and left their beloved farm behind to seek refuge in a safer place. After a difficult and life-threatening journey, they finally found refuge in May of 1945 in northern Germany. They had nothing left except the clothes on their bodies. But Oma continued with what she was able to do: she prayed with her children—every day. She sang with them the songs of Zion she had memorized by heart—every day.\nLife was extremely hard and for many years focused on simply making sure there was food on the table. But in 1955 my dad, then 17 years old, was going to trade school in the city of Rendsburg. He walked by a building and saw a small sign on the outside that read “Kirche Jesu Christi der Heiligen der Letzten Tage”—“The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.” He thought, “That is interesting; this is Mother’s church.” So when he came home, he told Oma that he had found her church.\nYou can imagine how she must have felt after almost 25 years of no contact with the Church. She was determined to attend the next Sunday and convinced my father to accompany her. Rendsburg was more than 20 miles (32 km) away from the little village where they lived. But this would not keep Oma from attending church. The next Sunday, she got on her bicycle together with my father and rode to church.\nWhen the sacrament meeting started, my dad sat down in the last row, hoping it would be over soon. This was Oma’s church and not his. What he saw was not very encouraging: only a few older women in attendance and two young missionaries who effectively ran everything in the meeting. But then they started to sing, and they sang the songs of Zion that my dad had heard since he was a little boy: “Come, Come, Ye Saints,” “O My Father,” “Praise to the Man.” Hearing this little flock sing the songs of Zion he’d known since childhood pierced his heart, and he knew immediately and without a doubt that the Church was true.\nThe first sacrament meeting my grandmother attended after 25 years was the meeting where my father received a personal confirmation of the truthfulness of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. He was baptized three weeks later, on September 25, 1955, together with my grandfather and my aunt.\nIt has been more than 70 years since that tiny sacrament meeting in Rendsburg. I often think about Oma, how she must have felt in those lonely nights, doing the small and simple things she was able to do, like praying, reading, and singing. As I stand here today in general conference and talk about my Oma, her determination to keep her covenants and trust in the Lord notwithstanding her struggles fills my heart with humility and gratitude—not only for her but for so many of our wonderful Saints throughout the world who focus on the simplicity in Christ in their challenging circumstances, perhaps seeing little change now but trusting that great things will come to pass some day in the future.\n\n4. Small and Simple Things\n\nI have learned through my own experience that the small and simple things of the gospel and faithfully focusing on Christ lead us to true joy, bring about mighty miracles, and grant us confidence that all promised blessings will come to pass. This is as true for you as it is true for me. In the words of Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, “Some blessings come soon, some come late, and some don’t come until heaven; but for those who embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ, they come.” Of this I also testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "Charles Dickens famously began his classic novel A Tale of Two Cities with the assertion that “it was the best of times, it was the worst of times.” In a sense, this is true in our day.\nWe live in a turbulent time when “the whole earth [is] in commotion.” President Russell M. Nelson’s admonition to be peacemakers, as followers of Jesus Christ, was emphasized beautifully this morning by Elder Gary E. Stevenson. This is an essential part of fostering unity, peace, and healing for “the worst of times.”\nWe also live in “the best of times,” which will be my emphasis. The Lord, in the preface to the Doctrine and Covenants, section 1, declared the fulness of the gospel would “be proclaimed … unto the ends of the world.” The Lord is truly hastening His work in our time. We should be profoundly grateful for the hastening, which has occurred and is occurring despite these challenging times. We live in a day when the Lord’s followers are privileged to hear His voice and respond with open hearts and minds. Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who are committed to the Savior and His commandments, are finding purpose and profound personal peace.\nAt various times in the history of the Church, there has been a significant increase in those who have entered the covenant path. One such period occurred between 1837 and 1850. Some of the early Apostles in the Lord’s restored Church served missions in the United Kingdom. These missions resulted in thousands joining the Church, and by 1850 there were more members of the Church living in the United Kingdom than in the United States. At that time, the Lord directed these Saints to gather to Utah. A mass emigration occurred, some supported by loans provided through the Perpetual Emigrating Fund.\nI love the account of the arrival to the Salt Lake Valley of a large number of converts from England and Wales in 1852. The group was met by the First Presidency at the mouth of Emigration Canyon, accompanied by Captain Pitt’s Band. The described them as “a band of pilgrims [including] sisters and children, walking, sunburnt, and weather-beaten, but not forlorn; their hearts were light and buoyant, which was plainly manifest by their happy and joyful countenances.”\nAs they “passed the Temple Block, … thousands of men, women, and children, gathered, from various parts of the city, to unite in the glorious and joyful welcome.” President Brigham Young addressed them: “May the Lord God of Israel bless you. … We have prayed for you continually; thousands of prayers have been offered up for you, day by day, to Him who has commanded us to gather Israel, save the children of men by the preaching of the gospel, and prepare them for the coming of the Messiah.”\nIn the spirit of that joyful occasion, let me once again assure all new converts and those returning to the Lord’s Church: We love you; we need you; the Lord needs you. We may not welcome you with marching bands, but we pray the blessings of heaven will attend your efforts to progress along the covenant path that leads to God the Father and Jesus Christ in the celestial kingdom.\nThere is clear evidence that faith in Jesus Christ is increasing in our day. In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, there has been a remarkable increase in converts and convert participation. In the last 36 months, nearly 900,000 converts have joined the Church. These converts constitute approximately 5 percent of the total Church membership. We welcome new members with open arms and deep appreciation for the path you have chosen.\nThese 900,000 converts in the last 36 months exceed the total membership of the Church at its 110th anniversary in 1940, which was just over 860,000 members. This was the year Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf, and I were born.\nThese wonderful new converts come from every part of the world. In the first six months of this year, conversions have risen by more than 20 percent over the previous year in Europe, Africa, Asia, the Pacific, and Latin America. In North America we have seen a 17 percent increase. The Lord’s work continues to move forward in powerful ways. These rising numbers are a clear witness that the gospel is touching hearts and changing lives everywhere.\nIn our day, these precious converts no longer gather to a central location. Because of the faith and consecration of the members of the Church, resources are available to support congregations—with the construction of chapels and temples—across the entire world. With the necessary priesthood keys and the resources provided, saving ordinances are now available in most parts of the world.\nRegardless of where we live, current members need to welcome hundreds of thousands of new members as we did the English and Welsh Saints I described from our early history. I loved Elder Gerrit W. Gong’s talk in this session where he taught us that no one should sit alone either emotionally or spiritually.\nOur sacred duty is to accept and welcome new and returning members. As the Lord hastens His work, we should love, nurture, and serve those who accept His gospel. We can help build a Zion people, where we are “of one heart and one mind, and [dwell] in righteousness.” To be one with the Lord, we must be one before the Lord. All members, regardless of baptism date, share a responsibility to welcome others.\nMy counsel to the members of the Church is to wrap our arms around these precious, elect people who have accepted the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nPresident Gordon B. Hinckley taught us that a new convert needs “a friend, a responsibility, and nurturing with ‘the good word of God’ (Moroni 6:4).” We can be among the friends who assure these new converts that they belong and are not just guests. We can help them understand that they are disciples of Jesus Christ who can minister to others and accept callings to serve. Young converts should consider serving a full-time mission. All should be determined to strive to live a Christlike life.\nMany join the Church at great personal sacrifice and desperately need the love and support of their fellow Saints.\nTo those of you who are new or returning to the faith, there are challenges you may face. Be patient with yourself. The missionaries have taught you the essential doctrine and explained the covenants and ordinances of the kingdom, which are set forth in the scriptures and in.\nReceiving the ordinances and covenants and living the commandments are essential. Focus on the covenants necessary for exaltation. The gospel makes exaltation possible, which requires the making and keeping of sacred covenants with God. Except for baptism, confirmation, and the conferral of the Melchizedek Priesthood for men, the covenants we enter are performed in the temple. For the dead, each of these saving ordinances is performed only in the temple. Accordingly, preparing yourself for the temple should be an immediate goal.\nYou will at times feel inadequate about what you know. Gospel knowledge is a great blessing obtained incrementally over time, but it is not a saving ordinance. The gospel is not a test of knowledge. However, as President Nelson has promised: “As you prayerfully study the Book of Mormon every day, you will make better decisions—every day. … As you ponder what you study, the windows of heaven will open, and you will receive answers to your own questions and direction for your own life.”\nIn addition, each year in rotation the Church curriculum in Sunday meetings covers the Old Testament, the New Testament, the Book of Mormon, and the Doctrine and Covenants. Over time you will feel more confident as your gospel knowledge grows. Regular study of the scriptures will bless and enrich your life by deepening your conversion to the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nLearning the pure doctrine of Jesus Christ is a lifelong pursuit, both in understanding doctrine and living a Christlike life. Essential covenants provide a framework which we describe as the covenant path. These principles have been powerfully taught by President Nelson. All members, especially new and returning ones, would be blessed by studying and adopting his prophetic messages on covenants and the covenant path.\nIf you set a goal of worthily receiving each covenant necessary for exaltation, you will be on the path that leads to the celestial kingdom. The temple and the ordinances of the temple should be our focus. Most covenants are available to each individual. One covenant, eternal marriage, involves uniting your efforts with a companion. Our goal should be to find that eternal companion.\nHowever, do not get discouraged if eternal marriage is not possible at this time. Prophets have taught that no blessing will be withheld from faithful members who keep the commandments. One Book of Mormon prophet, King Benjamin, said it beautifully: “Those that keep the commandments of God … are blessed in all things, … and if they [are] faithful to the end … they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness.”\nYou will find, if you have not already, that the members are not perfect. Revealed doctrine makes it clear that in our sojourn here on earth, we will make mistakes. We live in an imperfect and fallen world, not a celestial world. This life is a time of testing, with constant opportunities to repent and prove ourselves.\nAll of us feel inadequate as we strive to become like Jesus Christ. His Atonement allows us to repent daily as we fall short. As Nephi, another Book of Mormon prophet, said: “[We] must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.”\nAs we contemplate the challenges of our day, we must remember that the Savior, during His earthly ministry, also lived in turbulent and violent times. His focus was not on the political challenges of the day; it was on the perfection of the Saints.\nFollowing the Savior and His doctrine and teachings has never been easy in a world that is constantly in commotion. It was not easy for the Savior in the volatile world during His mortal sojourn, it was not easy for our early leaders and members, and it is not easy for us. Fortunately, living prophets provide the guidance we specifically need for our day. President Dallin H. Oaks will continue that spiritually powerful legacy.\nI testify that the doctrine of the Church of Jesus Christ is eternal and true. I bear my sure and certain witness that Jesus Christ lives and because of His Atonement, we can be one with Him. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "A Scriptural Understatement: Jesus Went About Doing Good\n\nJesus “went about doing good.” We read that simple report in the book of Acts. What an enormous understatement that is! Jesus surely did go about doing good! He is the very essence—and source—of goodness! He devoted His entire mortal life to doing good. He is “merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant,” infinite in goodness and everlasting in mercy.\nAny attempt at describing or summarising His goodness and mercy would be an understatement! Truly, as the Apostle John tried to express, if we were to attempt to record every manifestation of the Saviour’s goodness, “even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written.”\n\nJesus Christ Offers Each of Us a New Beginning\n\nThe specific examples we do have immortalised in scripture of Jesus going about “doing good” stir deep awe and wonder, especially when we really consider what it might have been like to be there, to witness His miracles, to receive His teachings, and to experience His healing. He conversed with the social outcasts, He touched the diseased and unclean, He brought comfort to the weary, He taught liberating truth, and He called sinners to repentance. To each leper, blind man, and adulterous woman; to the lame, the deaf, and the dumb; to every grieving mother, desperate father, and mourning widow; to the condemned, the shamed, and the suffering; to the dead in body and the dead in spirit, what He did was offer a new beginning. Yes, another staggering understatement!\nEverything He said and did provided a new beginning for each of those He healed, blessed, taught, and relieved of sin. He didn’t withdraw from them, and He certainly won’t withdraw from you. Imagine in this moment hearing any of these life-giving words from Him:\n“Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.”\n“Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.”\n“Be thou clean.”\n“Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.”\n“Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.”\nThe Saviour’s words to these individuals were brief, but with them He painted vast new horizons of forgiveness, healing, restoration, peace, and eternal life. And the glorious news is He offers the same new beginning to you and to me. All of us can have a new beginning through, and because of, Jesus Christ. Even you. New beginnings are at the heart of the Father’s plan for His children. This is the church of new beginnings! This is the church of fresh starts!\n\nThis Is the Church of New Beginnings\n\nWith baptism by water and the Spirit, we are “born again” and can “walk in newness of life.” How much hope does that new beginning bring to one who has trudged under the burden of sin or suffered from the effects of a troubled life and dysfunctional relationships? Jesus needed no forgiveness of sin Himself or a fresh start in life, yet He was baptised, showing us in high relief the way to the new beginning He has carved for each of us.\nAnd our new beginning doesn’t just happen once. We tend to think that our baptism is our one shot at a new beginning. It isn’t. We don’t have just one chance. These new beginnings can happen every day! And certainly every week as we eat a small piece of bread and drink a tiny cup of water in remembrance of the gift of our perfect Saviour, who died for the express purpose of giving us as many new beginnings as we need! Jesus gives us as many new beginnings as we need.\nWith commitment and rejoicing in a new life in Christ, we can become “a new creature,” where old things pass away and all things become new. What reprieve does that kind of new dawn bring to a soul who keeps trying, through continuing to choose faith in our Redeemer’s power to heal and restore, despite the crushing setbacks of living in a fallen world? The Saviour never gave up on His commitment to fulfill the will of the Father and complete His divine atoning mission, even through pain that caused Him to tremble, to bleed from every pore, to suffer body and spirit, and to pray that the bitter cup might be removed. Again, He was demonstrating for us what faithful endurance with God looks like.\nWith every covenant we make and every effort we give to keep it, we can receive “a new heart” and a fuller measure of “a new spirit.” Little by little, the more we invite His goodness into our hearts and cast out the self-defeating voices in our heads, we become His people because we truly make Him our God. Jesus so keenly wants to be our King and our Shepherd and our Prince of Peace, and we can choose to make Him so in our own hearts and minds.\n\nA New Beginning in How We View Repentance\n\nRepentance opens the door to our new beginnings, fresh starts, and second chances. Our dear President Russell M. Nelson’s teachings have cleared up misconceptions about the divine gift of repentance, and I think we are finally beginning to grasp it.\nIt is exciting to hear our youth describe what repentance means to them. I recently heard a young woman say, with a smile on her face, “When I think of repentance, daily repentance, I feel incredible joy and hope. I feel the love and happiness of my Heavenly Father and my Saviour. I am not afraid to come to Heavenly Father in prayer and ask for His help with whatever I’m struggling with. I know They’re not trying to catch me doing something wrong. Their arms are open wide. This is repentance to me,” she said. This young woman understands that because of Jesus Christ, she can have new beginnings!\n\nA New Beginning for Everyone, Every Time\n\nDo you need a new beginning? Can you make a fresh start, even you? Think about the people the Saviour ministered to—the people He taught, healed, raised, forgave, and restored. Was He selecting them from a particular economic class or background? Was He distinguishing between the righteous and the sinful? Was He singling people out because they were more deserving or more loved? No.\nSome came to Him with great faith, believing in His power to heal—like the woman with the issue of blood, the Roman centurion whose servant was dying, the leper, Jairus, and blind Bartimaeus. They each put their faith on the line, hoping that the goodness and power of the rabbi from Nazareth would change their lives and their prospects. And He did. He let His healing flow.\nBut Jesus also blessed those who had wavering faith, like the father of the sick child who cried out, perhaps as you have, “Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.” And He even poured out compassion upon those who hadn’t sought Him at all, like the woman taken in adultery, the widow of Nain, the disabled man at the pool of Bethesda, and the man born blind. Have you felt Him going about doing good in your life even when you haven’t been seeking Him or following Him?\nTo each of these scriptural figures, and to all who would listen and respond, He gave a new beginning, whether it was a new life forgiven of sin or a new life healed of disease or a new life raised from death.\nWhat does this mean for you and for me? His goodness and mercy and loving-kindness know no bounds. New beginnings are at the heart of the Father’s plan! Fresh starts are the mission of the Son! New dawns, new chapters, and new chances are the simple core of the gospel’s good news!\nSo, have you been away too long from your covenants to receive a new beginning? No. Have you done this or that too many times to be given another chance? No. Have you gone too far from Christ for Him to help you write a new story from here on out? No. The adversary is the only one who benefits from the idea that you’re sunk. You are not.\nAnd new beginnings are for more than just our sins and mistakes. Through the goodness and grace of the Saviour, we can have fresh starts that propel change in old mindsets, bad habits, grumpy dispositions, negative attitudes, feelings of powerlessness, and tendencies to blame others and avoid personal responsibility. You can actually change things about yourself that have been wearing you down for years. You can start again through the might of the Master of new beginnings. He never tires of giving new beginnings to us.\nTo those who are struggling with the same sin or the same setback over and over again, you keep going. He hasn’t put a roadblock in front of you. He hasn’t set a limit on your second chances. You press on. You keep striving. You seek help from those around you. And you trust in the new beginning that is there for you every time you turn back to your Father in sincerity of heart. Leave deliberate sinning, casual repeats, and prideful rebellion behind you, where they belong. You don’t have to be who you’ve been before. Embrace your fresh start, your second or third or fourth—or hundredth—chance, offered to you through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ.\nI am grateful beyond description for the new beginnings I have been given and for those I will yet be offered.\n\nConclusion\n\nOur Saviour uttered one final understatement, without which there would be no cause for hope or rejoicing this day. After the agonies of Gethsemane and at the conclusion of the torturous cross, He simply said, “It is finished.” Messianic prophecy had been fulfilled, and the full payment of the debt for humanity’s sins and suffering had been paid. He declared “finished” His infinite and eternal sacrifice. Yet His Atonement would not be complete until He Himself experienced new life on the third day, the new beginning, as a glorified, resurrected being through the power of the Father.\nBecause He always did those things which pleased His Father, and because He “suffered the will of the Father in all things,” you and I can have new beginnings. Please receive your new beginning, even today, right now. Jesus Christ is the Author and Finisher of our faith, writing countless new chapters with us. He is the Beginning and the End—the end of our shame and suffering and the beginning of a new life in Him, letting us receive His grace, leave the past behind, and begin again with a new dawn, as many times as we need. Truly His “goodness and mercy shall follow [us] all the days of [our lives].” In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "Recently I read of an experience that touched me deeply. It took place at the USA Masters Track and Field National Championship—a competition for seniors.\nOne of the participants in the 1,500-meter event was 100-year-old Orville Rogers. The author writes:\n“When the starter pistol fired, the runners took off, with Orville settling immediately into last place, where he remained alone for the entire race, shuffling along very slowly. [When] the last runner besides Orville finished, Orville still had two and a half laps to go. Nearly 3,000 spectators sat quietly watching him slowly make his way around the track—completely, silently, and uncomfortably alone.\n“[But] when he began his final lap, the crowd rose to their feet, cheering and applauding. By the time he hit the homestretch, the crowd was roaring. With the cheering encouragement of thousands of spectators, Orville called on his last reserves of energy. The crowd erupted with delight as he crossed the finish line and was embraced by his competitors. Orville humbly and gratefully waved to the crowd and walked off the track with his new friends.”\nThis was Orville’s fifth race of the competition, and in each of the other events, he had also taken last place. Some might have been tempted to judge Orville, thinking that he shouldn’t have even competed at his age—that he didn’t belong on the track because he greatly prolonged his events for everyone else.\nBut even though he always finished last, Orville broke five world records that day. No one watching him race would have believed that possible, but neither the spectators nor his competitors were the judges. Orville didn’t break any rules, and the officials didn’t lower any standards. He ran the same race and fulfilled the same requirements as all the other competitors. But his degree of difficulty—in this case, his age and limited physical capacity—was factored in by placing him in the 100-plus age division. And in that division, he broke five world records.\nJust as it took Orville great courage to step out on that track each time, it also takes great courage for some of our sisters and brothers to step into the arena of life every day, knowing they may be judged unfairly even though they’re doing the best they can against daunting odds to follow the Savior and honor their covenants with Him.\nNo matter where we live in the world, no matter our age, it is a basic human need for all of us to feel a sense of belonging, to feel that we are wanted and needed and that our lives have purpose and meaning, no matter our circumstances or limitations.\nOn the last lap of the race, the crowd overwhelmingly cheered Orville on, giving him the strength to keep going. It didn’t matter that he finished last. For the participants and the crowd, this was about far more than a competition. In many ways, this was a beautiful example of the Savior’s love in action. When Orville finished, they all rejoiced together.\nJust like the Masters Championship, our congregations and families can be gathering places where we cheer each other on—covenant communities fueled by the love of Christ for one another—helping each other overcome whatever challenges we face, giving each other strength and encouragement without judging one another. We need each other. Divine strength comes from unity, and that is why Satan is intent on dividing us.\nUnfortunately, for some of us, attending church can be hard at times for many different reasons. It could be someone struggling with questions of faith or someone with social anxiety or depression. It could be someone from a different country or race or someone with different life experiences or ways of seeing things who may feel they don’t fit the mold. It could even be sleep-deprived and emotionally stretched parents of babies and young children or someone who is single in a congregation full of couples and families. It could also be someone mustering the courage to return after years of being away or someone with a nagging feeling that they just don’t measure up and will never belong.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson said: “If a couple in your ward gets divorced, or a young missionary returns home early, or a teenager doubts his testimony, they do not need your judgment. They need to experience the pure love of Jesus Christ reflected in your words and actions.”\nOur experience at church is meant to provide vital connections with the Lord and with each other that are so needed for our spiritual and emotional well-being. Inherent in the covenants we make with God, beginning with baptism, is our responsibility to love and care for each other as members of the family of God, members of the body of Christ, and not just to check off a box on a list of things we’re expected to do.\nChristlike love and care are higher and holier. The pure love of Christ is charity. As President Nelson taught, “Charity propels us ‘to bear one another’s burdens’ [Mosiah 18:8] rather than heap burdens upon each other.”\nThe Savior said, “By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.” And President Nelson added: “Charity is the principal characteristic of a true follower of Jesus Christ.” “The Savior’s message is clear: His true disciples build, lift, encourage, persuade, and inspire. … How we speak to and about others … really matters.”\nThe Savior’s teaching on this is very simple. It’s summed up in the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have others do unto you. Put yourself in that person’s place and treat them the way you would want to be treated if you were in their shoes.\nChristlike treatment of others goes far beyond our families and congregations. It includes our sisters and brothers of other faiths or no faith at all. It includes our brothers and sisters from other countries and cultures, as well as those of different political persuasions. We are all part of the family of God, and He loves all His children. He desires that His children love Him and also one another.\nThe Savior’s life was an example of loving, gathering, and lifting even those who society had judged as outcasts and unclean. His is an example we are commanded to follow. We are here to develop Christlike attributes and eventually become like our Savior. His is not a gospel of checklists; it is a gospel of becoming—becoming as He is and loving as He does. He wants us to become a Zion people.\nWhen I was in my late 20s, I went through a period of deep depression, and during that time, it was as if the reality that God existed was suddenly gone. I can’t fully explain the feeling other than to say I felt completely lost. From the time I was a young child, I had always known that my Father in Heaven was there and that I could talk to Him. But during that time, I no longer knew if there was a God. I’d never experienced anything like that before in my life, and it felt like my whole foundation was crumbling.\nAs a result, it was hard for me to attend church. I went, but it was partly because I was afraid of being labeled “inactive” or “less faithful,” and I was afraid of becoming someone’s assigned project. What I really needed during that time was to feel genuine love, understanding, and support from those around me, not judgment.\nSome of the assumptions I was afraid people would make about me, I myself had made about others when they didn’t regularly attend church. That painful personal experience taught me some valuable lessons about why we’ve been commanded not to judge one another unrighteously.\nAre there those among us who suffer in silence, afraid for others to know their hidden struggles because they don’t know what the reaction will be?\nOnly the Lord fully knows the actual level of difficulty with which each of us is running our race of life—the burdens, the challenges, and the obstacles we face that often cannot be seen by others. Only He fully understands the life-changing wounds and trauma some of us may have experienced in the past that are still affecting us in the present.\nOften we even judge ourselves harshly, thinking we should be much farther ahead on the track. Only the Lord fully knows our individual limitations and capacity, and because of that, He is the only one fully qualified to judge our performance.\nSisters and brothers, let’s be like those spectators in the story and cheer each other on in our journey of discipleship no matter our circumstances! That doesn’t require us to break rules or lower standards. It’s actually the second great commandment—to love our neighbor as ourselves. And as our Savior has said, “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these … , ye have done it unto me,” for good or for ill. He has also told us, “If ye are not one ye are not mine.”\nThere will be times in each of our lives when we will be the ones who need help and encouragement. Let’s commit now to always do that for each other. As we do, we will develop greater unity and facilitate a space for the Savior to do His sacred work of healing and transforming each of us.\nTo each one of you who may feel you have lagged far behind in this race of life, this journey of mortality, please keep going. Only the Savior can fully judge where you should be at this point, and He is compassionate and just. He is the Great Judge of the race of life and the only one who fully understands the level of difficulty with which you are running or walking or shuffling. He will take into account your limitations, your capacity, your life experiences, and the hidden burdens you carry, as well as the desires of your heart. You may actually be breaking symbolic world records as well. Please don’t lose hope. Please keep going! Please stay! You do belong! The Lord needs you, and we need you!\nWherever you live in the world, no matter how remote it may be, please always remember that your Father in Heaven and your Savior know you completely and love you perfectly. You are never forgotten to Them. They want to bring you home.\nKeep your eye on the Savior. He is your iron rod. Don’t let go of Him. I testify that He lives and that you can trust Him. I also testify that He is cheering you on.\nMay we all follow the Savior’s example and cheer each other on is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "In the parable of the prodigal son, the elder brother initially struggled to celebrate when his younger brother returned home after a period of poor choices and “wast[ing] his substance with riotous living.” The elder brother’s pride and self-righteousness kept him from embracing the joy of his brother’s repentant return. We also may let opportunities pass us by without letting our loved ones know, through our words and actions, of our sincere love for them.\nThere are many powerful examples in the scriptures of sincere love shared and received: Naomi and Ruth, Ammon and King Lamoni, the prodigal son and his father, the Savior and His disciples.\nWhen love is freely given and sincerely received, a virtuous cycle ensues with an increase of love between both the giver and the receiver.\nGod’s love is perfect, infinite, enduring, and “most sweet.” It fills the soul with “exceedingly great joy.” Nevertheless, at times we may find it difficult to recognize God’s love in our lives. However, our perfectly loving Heavenly Father so deeply desires for us to experience His love that He “speaketh unto [us] according to … [our] understanding.” He will express His love for us in ways we, individually, can recognize. We may experience God’s love for us when we observe the beauties of nature, or receive answers to prayers, or have thoughts come to our mind in the very moment of need, or experience sweet moments of joy. The greatest manifestation of Heavenly Father’s love for us that resonates with both mind and heart is when He allowed His Beloved Son to offer Himself as the atoning one.\nLike the prodigal son’s elder brother, our focus is often centered on ourselves. We are so consumed with seeking evidence of God’s love for us, and we become frustrated when we do not see it. But the beautiful paradox is that the more we are focused on showing our love for God, the more easily we recognize His love for us. Perhaps this is why the Savior responded to the question “Which is the great commandment?” with this simple and important invitation: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.”\nSometimes the way we show our love to those we hold most dear is not necessarily the way they recognize love. This may be frustrating for both the giver and the receiver. It may be helpful to ask those we love how they recognize love expressed. Likewise, if we want to show our love for God, we should understand how He recognizes our love. Fortunately, He has clearly outlined several ways in the scriptures that we can show our love for Him.\n\nLovest Thou Me More Than These?\n\nIn the instructive exchange between Peter and the resurrected Lord at the Sea of Tiberias, we learn of ways we can show our love for the Lord.\n“Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee.”\nThe key question in this inquiry by the Lord is “Lovest thou me more than these?” We show our love to the Lord when we put Him above “these,” and “these” can be anyone, any activity, or anything that displaces Him from being the most important influence in our lives.\nThere will never be enough time in a day, a week, a month, or a year to get done all we want or need to accomplish. Part of the test of mortality is to use the precious resource of time for what is most important for our eternal good and to let go of those things that are less important.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson said: “The question for each of us … is the same. … Are you willing to let God be the most important influence in your life? Will you allow His words, His commandments, and His covenants to influence what you do each day? Will you allow His voice to take priority over any other? Are you willing to let whatever He needs you to do take precedence over every other ambition? Are you willing to have your will swallowed up in His?” We demonstrate our discipleship and love for God when we make Him our top priority.\n\nFeed My Sheep\n\nIn the next verse of this same discussion between Peter and the Savior, we learn of another way the Lord recognizes our expressions of love: “[The Lord] saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.”\nWe show our love for Heavenly Father when we serve, listen to, love, lift, or minister to His children. That service may be as simple as truly seeing others without judgment. In the 76th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, we get a glimpse of the character of those who will inherit a celestial glory: “They see as they are seen, and know as they are known.” They see others as God sees them, and He sees them as they can become, with glorious divine potential.\nAfter returning home from my mission, I took over the lawn-care business my brothers and I had started as teenagers. I was also busy with my university studies. One spring week, heavy rain and looming final exams left me overwhelmed and behind on yard work.\nMidweek the skies cleared, and I planned to catch up on yard work after classes. But when I arrived home, my truck and equipment were gone. Curious, I visited the scheduled yards; each one had already been beautifully trimmed. At the last yard on the schedule, I saw my younger brother walking behind the mower. He saw me, smiled, and waved. Overcome with gratitude, I hugged and thanked him. His meaningful act of service deeply strengthened my love and loyalty for him. Serving each other is an unmistakable way we show our love for God and His Beloved Son.\n\nConfess His Hand in All Things\n\nWe also manifest our love for God by having a grateful heart. The Lord said, “In nothing doth man offend God, … save those who confess not his hand in all things.” We show our love for God by acknowledging Him as the source of every good thing in our lives.\nIn the early days of launching a company, my business partner and I would pray earnestly before important meetings, asking for Heavenly Father’s help. Time after time, God answered our prayers, and our meetings went well. After one meeting, my business partner pointed out that we had been quick to ask for help but slow to give thanks. From then on, we made it a habit to offer sincere prayers of gratitude, recognizing the Lord’s hand in our successes. We show our love for God with “an attitude of gratitude.”\n\nIf Ye Love Me, Keep My Commandments\n\nAnother way we show our love for Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son is to choose to obey Them. The Savior said, “If ye love me, keep my commandments.” This kind of obedience is neither blind nor compulsory but is a sincere and willing expression of love. Father in Heaven wants us to want to be obedient. Sister Tamara W. Runia called this “affectionate obedience.” She said, “Even though we don’t have perfect obedience yet, we try affectionate obedience now, choosing to stay, again and again, because we love Him.”\nHeavenly Father gave us agency to inspire us to want to choose Him. His work and glory is not only to bring to pass our eternal life but also includes a hope that our greatest desire is to return to Him. However, He will never force us to obey. In the hymn “Know This, That Every Soul Is Free,” we sing:\n\nHe’ll call, persuade, direct aright,\nAnd bless with wisdom, love, and light,\nIn nameless ways be good and kind,\nBut never force the human mind.\n\nAs mission leaders, my wife, Christina, and I were inspired by so many missionaries who chose to be obedient not only because it was a missionary standard but because they wanted to show their love for the Lord by humbly choosing to represent Him.\nElder Dale G. Renlund said: “Our Heavenly Father’s goal in parenting is not to have His children do what is right; it is to have His children choose to do what is right and ultimately become like Him. If He simply wanted us to be obedient, He would use immediate rewards and punishments to influence our behaviors.” We show our love for God when we choose to obey and follow Him.\nOur Heavenly Father and our Savior recognize our expressions of love for Them when we put Them first in our lives, serve one another, gratefully acknowledge every blessing from Them, and choose to obey and follow Them.\nI testify that each one of us truly is a child of God and He loves us perfectly. I testify that He yearns for us to experience His love in ways we recognize and understand. And the beautiful paradox is that we will experience His love for us even more deeply as we show our love for Him. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "Christ is the Good Shepherd. Each one of the flock is precious to Him. He patterned shepherding and taught us by word and deed the qualities of a good shepherd, including knowing your sheep by name, loving them, finding those that are lost, feeding, and, ultimately, leading them back home again. He expects us to do the same as His undershepherds.\nWe can learn much about ministering the Lord’s way from the ancient prophet—and exceptional shepherd—Moroni. He lived during very difficult times, not having the benefits of cell phones, computers, and the internet. But he managed to keep track of the sheep. How was this done? We get a glimpse into his methodology in Moroni 6. There we read that members “were numbered among the people of the church of Christ; and their names were taken, that they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of God, to keep them in the right way. … The church did meet together oft, to fast and to pray, and to speak one with another concerning the welfare of their souls” (Moroni 6:4–5; emphasis added).\nFor Moroni, it was all about people—names! He practiced the principle of counting and accounting so that all would be remembered. Any who struggled or wandered were noticed, allowing the Saints to discuss their welfare in councils. Like the shepherd who left the ninety and nine (safe and secure, I am certain) and went after the one that was lost (see Luke 15:4–7), we have been asked to be just as aware of our flocks—to notice and remember and go and do likewise.\nAs a mission leader in India, I recall asking a young branch president about some of his goals for the coming year: “How many men will you prepare to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood?” His immediate response was “Seven!”\nI wondered from where in the ether he had conjured up that very specific number! Before I could respond, he produced a piece of paper with the numbers one through seven written down the side. The first five lines had names on them—real people that he and his elders quorum were going to invite and encourage to have the blessing of the priesthood in their lives. Of course, I had to ask about the empty lines six and seven. “Oh, President,” he said, shaking his head sympathetically, “surely we will baptize at least two men in the first of the year who could have the priesthood by the end of the year.” This superb leader understood the principle of counting and accounting.\nChrist has organized His Church in such a way that it should be difficult to forget a soul, for each is dear to Him. Every individual in a ward, regardless of age or gender, has a multitude of stewards—shepherds—who are tasked with looking after them, with remembering. A young man, for example, has assigned to his well-being a bishopric, ministering brothers, adult youth advisers, seminary teachers, quorum presidencies, and then some—all serving as safety nets, strung up firmly beneath that youth to catch him if he falls. Even if just one net is properly positioned, that young man will be safe, noticed, and remembered. And yet, often we find nary a net in place. People wander off routinely into the mists—and no one notices. How can we be better shepherds? We can learn to count and account.\nThe Church supplies us with reports and tools to do just that—to remember. The Quarterly Report is a prime example. It allows us to count and account for each member multiple times and to notice those who go missing or need our help and our love. The Action and Interview List identifies those who require our attention right now, as do the Temple Recommend Status report and others. These counting and accounting tools focus us in on people. Who needs a calling, a priesthood advancement, or help taking a family name to the temple? Who could we be helping to prepare for a full-time mission? Who went missing this month? These tools help us to remember people.\nI knew a family from the United States who took an assignment in Africa. On their very first Sunday, they walked into the only Church unit in the country, where they were greeted enthusiastically. By the end of the morning, the man’s wife had been called as the Relief Society president and he as the Young Men leader! He asked an exhausted-looking branch president how many young men there were. This faithful, first-generation leader pointed to the back of the sacrament hall and said, “Those two right there.” The man was appropriately skeptical, so he took a branch roster home, quickly noting that there were actually 20 young men on the list. He returned to the branch president and asked for two dynamic, bilingual young adults to serve as his counselors and then sat down with them and the two boys to review the names.\nThen these diligent young people went to work. Over the next few months, they found every boy listed. Name by name, those lost sheep were welcomed back by their peers and fed spiritually and physically! Within a year, on any given Sunday, there was an average of 21 young men in attendance. Thank goodness for young men who counted and accounted.\nA dear friend of mine, as a young graduate student, moved with his family to a large American city to continue his education. He was immediately called to preside over the elders quorum. A little nervous about his first interview with the stake president, he was determined to go prepared. He told the stake president that he had three goals for the upcoming year: (1) 90 percent ministering, (2) a substantive gospel lesson each week, and (3) a well-planned quorum activity every month.\nSmiling at my friend, this wise stake president asked, “Can you name a less-active quorum member who you could help get to the temple with his family this year?” That caught my friend by surprise. He thought carefully and came up with a name. “Write that down,” directed the stake president. Then this experienced leader asked the same question three more times—and the interview was over. This young man walked out of that interview having learned one of his greatest lessons on leadership and ministering. He went into the interview with programs, lessons, and activities. He walked out with names! Those four names subsequently became a major focus of his ministry and that of his quorum.\nAs a mission leader, I visited one of my branches one Sunday morning. I noticed that the branch president kept taking a card out of his pocket and writing on it. I decided to ask him about that after the closing prayer. Once the meeting ended and before I could inquire about the card, the branch mission leader raced to the podium, where he was handed the paper. I quickly followed this enthusiastic leader to his weekly branch missionary coordination meeting. Before they started, he took the paper out of his pocket. It was filled with the names of members who had been missing from sacrament meeting. Within a few minutes, each member of the council had selected a name or two, committing to visit them that very day to make sure that they were OK and to let them know that they had been missed. Now that is counting and accounting.\nI recall a district, hours by jet from the nearest temple, where maintaining a current recommend was a high priority, despite the fact that it would likely never be used. The first Sunday of each month, leaders used their counting tools to account for their endowed members. If they found that a recommend was soon to expire, the executive secretary would schedule a renewal interview. People with expired recommends were counseled over, then sought out to assist them in returning to the covenant path. I asked how many of their endowed members had a current recommend. The answer was an astounding 98.6 percent. When asked about the six whose recommends had expired, the leaders were able to identify them by name and described to me the efforts being made to get them back!\nA few years ago, my family moved back to the United States. We were excited to attend church here after 26 amazing years in smaller, more isolated units. I was called as a ward missionary. We had a great ward mission leader and were doing exciting things and teaching wonderful people. I asked to attend a ward council meeting to observe and to get their help with the friends we were working with. I was surprised when all that was discussed was an upcoming ward activity. I approached the ward mission leader afterward and opined that he didn’t get the chance to return and report on our people. His response? “Oh, I never get to report.”\nI contrasted that with a branch council meeting in Lahore, Pakistan, that I had attended just weeks before. This little group sat around a small table together, and all they talked about were people. Names. Each leader reported on their stewardship and the individuals and families that they were concerned about. All had the chance to add their thoughts on the best ways that they could bless those being discussed. Plans were made and assignments given. What a brilliant lesson in counting and accounting by name from our first-generation brothers and sisters.\nIn the Church of Jesus Christ, we have been instructed by prophets past and prophets present—and by the pattern set by our Savior—how to minister. We take names, we remember, and we counsel over the welfare of souls. Leaders who do this will never run out of agenda items in their council meetings! The principle of counting and accounting works. It is the Lord’s way. We can do better. To God, who created the universe and rules over all, this work—His work and glory—is very personal. And so it should be for each of us, as instruments in His hands in His amazing work of salvation and exaltation. Miracles in the lives of real people will result. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "I express my love for President Russell M. Nelson and my gratefulness for the remarkable influence he has had on each of us. And for all of us, I thank God for preserving and magnifying the noble life of President Dallin H. Oaks.\nWith each passing year, I feel greater love for our Savior, Jesus Christ, and for His merciful Atonement. His supreme sacrifice, securing victory over death and sin, is the most consequential contribution of all human history. Understanding His divine gift is for me an open-ended heavenly tutorial that will continue beyond the grave.\n\nThe powerful compassion of the Savior in forgiving sin and in healing the wounds caused by the sins of others is a most miraculous manifestation of the love of God.\nMy desire is to offer hope for those seeking forgiveness for very serious sins and to offer comfort to those seeking healing from the anguishing wounds caused by the serious sins of others.\nHealing and forgiveness are each found in their fulness in the atoning love of Jesus Christ.\n\nFaith in Jesus Christ\n\nIf you have committed serious sins and are in the process of repenting or have the desire to fully repent and feel the unspeakable joy of forgiveness, please know this miracle is awaiting you. The Savior continuously calls, “Come unto me.”\nStrengthening your faith in our Savior, Jesus Christ, will invigorate the yearning of your soul to know Him, believe in Him, and yield your heart to Him. Enos asked about his own forgiveness, “Lord, how is it done?” The Lord responded, “Because of thy faith in Christ, whom thou hast never before heard nor seen.”\nAnd Moroni added, “If ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you.”\nTurning from sin, turning toward God, and strengthening your faith in Jesus Christ are a beautiful beginning. Humbly submitting your will to God includes acknowledging serious sins to your bishop or branch president, but your full forgiveness comes from the Savior. Forgiveness is a divine gift offered through the grace of Jesus Christ.\n\nHonesty\n\nA desire to truly return to God is accompanied by the determination to be completely honest with your Heavenly Father, with yourself, with those who were harmed, and with your priesthood leader. Your Heavenly Father rejoices in your resolve to come unto Him with a broken heart and contrite spirit. Having a contrite spirit is humbly putting yourself in the hands of God; having a broken heart brings what the Apostle Paul described as “godly sorrow,” a deep longing of the soul to return to Him whatever the cost.\n\nRestoring What Is Broken\n\nYour yearning leads you to want to repair what you have broken. Yet, realizing some things are not in your power to repair, you fervently pray that the Lord, through His grace, will help heal those who have been hurt in consequence of your actions.\nThe effects of serious sin on others are often painfully difficult to overcome. Are you following the example of the sons of Mosiah, who were “zealously striving to repair all the injuries which they had done”? Speak with those you respect about what you might not be seeing.\nAs I was preparing this talk, I received an unexpected email from someone in the process of repenting and desiring to return to the Church. His former wife was still suffering from the loss “of [their] eternal marriage, [difficulties with the children], the loss of financial security, … not [being] quite able to keep up with expenses, [and] the deeply suffocating feelings of being betrayed.”\nHe shared with me how his priesthood leader “felt impressed to [ask him] to prayerfully consider what [more he could do for his former wife and children].” With permission, I share a part of his email:\n“I [first] thought the [money] I gave up in the divorce decree was more than generous, but my branch president encouraged me to fast and pray about it. …\n“Initially, I struggled with the idea of further restitution. Since my sins weren’t financial, I wondered what a ‘generous restitution’ truly meant … [but] I soon realized it wasn’t just about money.\n“My priesthood leaders met with [my former wife] and my children and realized they were still struggling and hadn’t healed. …\n“My new goal was to move forward with faith. … I simply expressed my desire to help with no strings attached. … I decided to [send my former wife a specific amount] per paycheck, which was a significant portion of my net pay. Just before making the first payment, the Lord [impressed upon my mind that I needed] to pay [twice that amount].\n“I’ve learned that restitution isn’t just about money. It’s about humbly dedicating my life to the Lord. … The money is to help replace what I took from my family due to my poor choices. It’s about making and keeping promises without expecting anything in return and helping her not worry about bills so she can seek the Spirit.”\nYour efforts to restore what you have broken may have nothing to do with money, but as you humbly counsel with the Lord, you may find there is more you can do.\n\nDivine Approval by Degrees\n\nAs you seek the Lord’s forgiveness, be patient as you wait upon His full approval. Consider this scripture:\n“They … humble[d] themselves … in the depths of humility; and … did cry mightily to God; yea, even all the day long. … [But] the Lord was slow to hear their cry because of their iniquities.”\n“Nevertheless the Lord did hear their cries, and began … to ease their burdens; … and … they began to prosper by degrees.”\nBe patient as the Lord gives you His blessing and approval by degrees.\nIn the Lord’s time, you will feel His voice telling you, “Let these things trouble you no more.” One day, as you continue to turn to the Savior, your Heavenly Father will take “away the guilt from [your heart], through the merits of his Son.”\n\nInjured and Suffering\n\nFor you who have been so unfairly injured by the serious sins of another, I long to share the Savior’s love and compassion, His comfort and peace.\nThe sadness you have felt, the heartbreak, the loss, the suffocating feeling of betrayal, the upending of your life as you imagined it to be—I give you my absolute assurance, the Savior knows you and loves you. Reach out to Him. He is your comfort and strength; He will send His angels to bear you up. When will your pain be gone, your grief subdued, the unwanted memories forgotten? I do not know. But this I do know: He has the power to bring beauty from the ashes of your suffering.\nOur beloved brothers and sisters of Grand Blanc, Michigan, with their undaunted faith in Jesus Christ, with their courage and unselfishness, have received and will, in the weeks and months ahead, abundantly receive of the Savior’s incomparable love and grace.\nAs you continue to place your trust in Him, your clouds of darkness and anguished sobbing in the night will be transformed into cascading tears of joy and peace in the morning’s light. “Your sorrow shall be turned into joy. … And your joy no [one] taketh from you.” That moment will come. I testify that it will come.\n\nThe atoning love of Jesus Christ can be found in the most difficult situations, but we all constantly need the atoning grace of our Savior. President Dallin H. Oaks has taught: “Because of His atoning experience in mortality, our Savior is able to comfort, heal, and strengthen all men and women everywhere, but I believe He does so only for those who seek Him and ask for His help. The Apostle James taught, ‘Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up’ (James 4:10). We qualify for that blessing when we believe in Him and pray for His help.”\n\nElder Robert E. Wells\n\nI received permission from my dear friend and emeritus General Authority Seventy, Elder Robert E. Wells, now 97 years old, to share his experience of more than 60 years ago:\nWhile living in Paraguay in 1960 and employed as an international banker, Robert Wells, then 32 years old, and his wife, Meryl, were each a pilot in two different planes, flying home from Uruguay to Paraguay. Encountering thick clouds, Robert and Meryl lost visual and radio contact with each other. Robert quickly landed, where he learned his wife’s plane had crashed. Neither his wife nor the two friends flying with her had survived. His children, at home in Asunción, were ages seven, five, and two.\n\nElder Wells spoke of his grief:\n“Words will forever be inadequate in expressing the pain that swelled within me, consuming my emotions and numbing my senses. Profound tears of sorrow simply wouldn’t stop flowing. To make matters worse, as my mind was attempting to deal with the devastating realization of my wife’s passing, I found myself experiencing tremendous guilt for feeling I was responsible for the crash.”\nRobert blamed himself for not having had the plane inspected more thoroughly and for not giving his wife better instrument flying instructions. He felt he was guilty of neglect.\nRobert said:\n“My mind went into a dark daze. … I simply existed—[for the sake of the children,] nothing more.”\n“I … lost my desire to continue on.”\nIn time, Robert was blessed with a deeply spiritual experience. He recounted:\n“One evening, about one year later, while on my knees in prayer, a miracle occurred. While praying and pleading to my Heavenly Father, I felt as though the Savior came to my side and I heard an audible voice speaking these words to my soul and to my ears: ‘Robert, my atoning sacrifice paid for your sins and your mistakes. Your wife forgives you. Your friends forgive you. I will lift your burden. …’\n“From that moment, the burden of guilt [and despair] was amazingly lifted from me. I had been rescued! I immediately understood the encompassing power of the Savior’s Atonement and … that it applied directly to me. … I … experienced light and joy like I had never before known. … I had been given an unearned gift—the Lord’s gift of grace. … I didn’t deserve it—I had done nothing to merit it, but He gave it to me nonetheless.”\nBrothers and sisters, may we each be “sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, through the shedding of the blood of Christ, … [becoming] holy, without spot.”\nI testify of the love, the mercy, and the grace of our Savior and Redeemer. He lives. We are His; we are children of the covenant. As we believe in Him, follow Him, and trust Him, He will lift us from our sorrows and our sins. Then, beyond this mortal life, in our Father’s house, we will live with Him forever and ever. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "With love unfeigned we all echo President Oaks’s tribute to the passing of President Russell M. Nelson. And with equal love and deep mourning, we all acknowledge the tragedies in Michigan recently and almost daily around the world. We acknowledge these things with love and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ.\nThe ninth chapter of John records the experience of Jesus and His disciples passing near a beggar, blind from birth. This led the disciples to ask Jesus several complex religious questions regarding the origin and transmission of this man’s limitation. The Master responded by doing something very simple and very surprising. He spit into the dirt and stirred a small mixture of clay. He then applied this to the eyes of the man, instructing him to wash in the pool of Siloam. All this the sightless man obediently did and “came [forth] seeing,” the scripture says. How important evidence is, as opposed to wishes or argument or even malice in opposition to the truth.\nWell, afraid this miracle would again add to the threat Jesus already posed to their presumed authority, the enemies of the Savior confronted the newly sighted man and said in anger, “We know [Jesus] is a sinner.” The man listened for a moment, then said, “Whether he be a sinner … , I know not: [but] one thing I [do] know, … whereas I was blind, now I see.”\nJesus gave the first meaning to this exchange, telling His disciples that all this had happened “that the works of God should be made manifest.” Remember that twice in this narrative the Savior’s action was referred to as “anointing” the blind man’s eyes, an act to be completed by washing. This description of “the works of God [being] made manifest” could possibly suggest the unfolding of an ordinance.\nAnother truth that is evident here are the instruments the Creator of heaven and earth and all that in them are used to provide this miracle: spit and a handful of dirt! These very unlikely ingredients declare that God can bless us by whatever method He chooses. Like Naaman resisting the River Jordan or the children of Israel refusing to look at the serpent on the staff, how easy it is for us to dismiss the source of our redemption because the ingredients and the instruments seem embarrassingly plain.\nBut we remember from the Book of Mormon that some things are both plain and precious and that prior to Jesus’s birth, it would be prophesied that “he [would have] no form nor comeliness; and when we [should] see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.” How often God has sent His majestic message through a newly called and very anxious Relief Society president or an unlearned boy on a New York farm or a brand-new missionary or a baby lying in a manger.\nSo what if the answers to our prayers come in plain or convoluted ways? Are we willing to persevere, to keep trying to live Christ’s gospel no matter how much spit and clay it takes? It may not always be clear to us what is being done or why, and from time to time, we will all feel a little like the senior sister who said, “Lord, how about a blessing that isn’t in disguise?”\nConsider the evidence of another truth, this one regarding the holy priesthood. In documenting the organization of the meridian Church, Luke’s first line reads, “Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority,” gifts not granted on the basis of impressive credentials nor determined by tradition or birthright. They are not bestowed by a divinity school or a theological seminary. They are conferred only by the laying on of hands by one who has had authorized hands laid on him in an unbroken sequence back to the source of all divine authority, the Lord Jesus Christ.\nAnd in a church that understands the gift of mercy, wouldn’t it be another marvelous evidence of that church’s truthfulness to see these blessings and covenants go to our deceased kindred, those of our families who have gone before us? Should they be penalized because they did not have access to the gospel or because they were born at a time or in a place when divine ordinances and covenants were not available to them? The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has sacred, dedicated houses of the Lord in which merciful, salvific work is being done vicariously every day and night for these deceased, as well as offering worship opportunities and ordinances for the living. To my knowledge, this particular evidence of God’s truth, His universal love for the living and the dead, is not seen elsewhere in the world—except in one church that demonstrates truth in this particular regard: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nMy first sight-giving, life-giving encounter with real evidence of truth did not come with anointing clay or in the pool of Siloam. No, the instrument of truth that brought my healing from the Lord came as pages in a book, yes, the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ! The claims about this book have been attacked and dismissed by some unbelievers, the anger often matching the vitriol of those who told the healed man that he could not possibly have experienced what he knew he had experienced.\nIt has been hurled at me that the means by which this book came to be were impractical, unbelievable, embarrassing, even unholy. Now, that is harsh language from anyone who presumes to know the means by which the book came to be, inasmuch as the only description given about those means is that it was translated “by the gift and power of God.” That’s it. That’s all. In any case, the impact of the Book of Mormon in my life is no less miraculous than was the application of spit and dirt placed on the blind man’s eyes. It has been, for me, a rod of safety for my soul, a transcendent and penetrating light of revelation, an illumination of the path I must walk when mists of darkness come. And surely they have, and surely they will.\nAnd given the view it has granted me of my Savior’s universal love and redeeming grace, I share with you my witness, justified here as the newly blessed man’s parents said their son should be heard because he was “of age.” Well, so am I. He was old enough to be taken seriously, they implied. Well, so am I. I am two months away from my 85th birthday. I have been at the edge of death and back. I have walked with kings and prophets, with presidents and apostles. Best of all, I have at times been overwhelmed by the Holy Spirit of God. I trust that my witness should be given at least some consideration here.\nNow, brothers and sisters, I came to my whole-souled conviction that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a true restoration of the New Testament Church—and more—because I could not deny the evidence of that restoration. Since those first experiences, I suppose I have had a thousand—ten thousand?—other evidences that what I have spoken of today is true. So I am delighted now to join my friend huddled on the streets of Jerusalem, where with my diminished voice I sing:\n\nAmazing grace—how sweet the sound—\nThat saved a wretch like me!\nI once was lost, but now am found,\nWas blind, but now I see.\n\nIn the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "While the Savior was traveling through Bethsaida, some individuals brought a blind man to Him. Perhaps they were hoping to see a miracle firsthand. The Savior “took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town” to heal him privately. Initially, the healing seemed less than effective. The man “looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.” Jesus, compassionately, “put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up.” With that additional touch of the Savior’s hands, the blind man now “saw … clearly.”\nThis is just one example of how the Savior’s life is characterized by humble acts of service. He reminds us that He “came not to be ministered unto, but to minister” and then invites us to follow His example by going the extra mile, giving to those who ask of us, and loving our neighbor. When asked, “Who is my neighbour?” Christ shared the parable of the good Samaritan, with a charge to “go, and do thou likewise.”\nMissionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are modern-day examples of the good Samaritan that Christ invites us to become. I would like to highlight those missionaries who are called to service assignments. They are examples to us of how service (1) opens hearts to the gospel of Jesus Christ, (2) allows all of us to minister regardless of our circumstances, and (3) brings the power of Christ into our lives.\n\nFirst, Service Opens Hearts to the Gospel of Jesus Christ\n\nIn about 91 BC, Ammon, a Book of Mormon missionary, introduced himself to King Lamoni by saying, “I desire to dwell among this people for a time; … [and] I will be thy servant.” Because of his service to the king, Ammon was granted an opportunity to “speak boldly, … and tell [King Lamoni] … by what power” he had performed his service. In return, the king promised that “whatsoever [Ammon] desirest … [the king would] grant it.” Ammon’s only request was that the king listen to the message of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Ammon’s service resulted in “thousands of souls [brought] to repentance.”\nIn our day, service continues to lead others to the gospel. Sister Bevan was serving as a teaching missionary when she began experiencing health issues requiring her to return home for treatment. Instead of being released, she was able to continue serving as a service missionary from home.\nWhile visiting a park, Sister Bevan and a friend were prompted to talk to a mother with four young children, but they hesitated and the family drove away. The next day, they returned to the park, praying that this family would be there. Miraculously, the mother was sitting in the exact same spot as the day before. This time Sister Bevan and her friend approached the mother, got to know her, and discovered that she was in desperate need of temporal help. They provided assistance and then invited her to learn about the gospel.\nBecause of that service and invitation, the mother and her oldest child were baptized, followed by the next oldest a year later. They remain active members today. Sister Bevan knew this experience was divinely inspired, and it “proved to [her] that [she] was exactly where God needed [her] to be.”\nLike Ammon and Sister Bevan, as we serve others, we “show forth good examples unto them” and they desire to know the “reason of the hope that is in [us].”\nJesus invites us to “go, and do thou likewise.”\n\nSecond, Service Allows All of Us to Minister Regardless of Our Circumstances\n\nPresident Russell M. Nelson called on “every worthy, able young man to prepare for and serve a mission” and for every able young sister to “pray to know if the Lord would have [her] serve a mission.” He promised that “your decision to serve a mission, whether a proselyting or a service mission, will bless you and many others.” Service missions changed the definition of the word able. Now every worthy young man and woman who desires to serve a full-time mission for the Lord can do so, with very few exceptions.\nElder Holgado is an example of being able to serve regardless of personal circumstances. He was born with a rare genetic disorder, which precluded him from serving a teaching mission. Elder Holgado was called as a service missionary and volunteered in the bishops’ storehouse, where he helped others get the assistance they needed. He stocked shelves, bagged vegetables, and crushed cardboard boxes.\nAs Elder Holgado spoke in sacrament meeting after his mission, he shared that “God needs service missionaries. He needs people to love and serve others. These people stock toilet paper, bag broccoli, build furniture, and are good to people.”\nYou don’t need to have a service assignment or wear a name tag to do good. Every act of service is recognized by the Savior. We are all able to help others come unto Christ by serving with loving-kindness. We can all minister in Christ’s name to the one through the power of the Holy Ghost and live as examples of faith in Jesus Christ. Service allows us to present ourselves as living sacrifices who are acceptable to God.\nJesus invites us to “go, and do thou likewise.”\n\nThird, Service Brings the Power of Christ into Our Lives\n\nA young missionary who transferred from a teaching assignment to a service assignment struggled with some personal challenges that left him needing Christ’s healing power. Consecrated service brought that power into his life. He said, “I felt that when I was struggling, I could feel Christ lifting me up. There is something special about seeing Him bless people through a food pantry, in the temple, and through His gospel.”\nThis elder began to feel deeper joy, and his newfound enthusiasm blessed him and his entire family. The Spirit entered their home more abundantly, they attended the temple together more regularly, and Christ became a greater focus in their family. This missionary believes that Christ saved his life and blessed his family through service.\nPresident Nelson taught, “Willingness to serve and strengthen others stands as a symbol of one’s readiness to be healed” by the redemptive power of the Savior.\nJesus invites us to “go, and do thou likewise.”\n\nService Missionaries Are Examples of Consecrated Disciples of Jesus Christ\n\nWhen you or a family member is blessed with a call as a service missionary, that is a moment to celebrate. Your family will now have a set-apart representative of the Lord Jesus Christ living in your home. That will change all of you for the good. There should be no disappointment in any call to serve. We sing, “I’ll go where you want me to go” and “I’ll be what you want me to be.” Here is an opportunity to show that we really mean what we say!\nTo all of you who serve, and especially to the over 4,000 young service missionaries, we love you! If teaching missionaries are the Lord’s mouth, then service missionaries are the Lord’s hands, and you are not second-class missionaries. Each of you is vital to the gathering of Israel. President Nelson taught that “anytime we do anything that helps anyone … to make and keep their covenants with God, we are helping to gather Israel.”\nYou service missionaries gather Israel in so many ways, and your service changes lives. Often you don’t know who the beneficiary of your service is, but God knows. Always remember that “inasmuch as ye [serve] one of the least of these, … ye [serve Him].” We hear your voices as you volunteer at Church call centers; we see your smiles as you help in community organizations; and we feel your light as you serve in temples. You feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and give drink to the thirsty.\nWe all need to go and do likewise.\n\nService Is the Lifeblood of Disciples of Christ\n\nService has the power to open hearts to the gospel and allows all of us to give our whole soul to Christ. It changes our hearts to become more like Him, and in the process, we lift others. President Nelson once asked, “In this world smitten with spiritual decay, can individuals … make a difference?” His answer: “Yes! … ‘The covenant people of the Lord, … armed … with the power of God in great glory’ … can lift the lives of all humankind.” Through service we change hearts—and the world.\nChrist “went about doing good.” He ministered to the sick, gave sight to the blind, and visited the downtrodden. He cooked meals, helped at wedding feasts, and fed thousands who were hungry. As we give service in Christ’s name to the one, we become increasingly holy and worthy of the gift of eternal life. Jesus Christ lives. He is my Savior and yours. He is our Redeemer. He is our great example of ministering. I invite each of us to go and do likewise. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "In May 2021, while visiting the renovation work of the Salt Lake Temple, President Russell M. Nelson marveled at the efforts of the pioneers who, with limited resources and unwavering faith, built that sacred edifice, a physical and spiritual masterpiece that has stood the test of time. However, he also observed the effects of erosion, which over time had caused gaps in the temple’s original foundation stones and instability in the masonry, clear signs of the need for structural reinforcement.\n\nOur beloved prophet then taught us that just as it was necessary to implement major measures to strengthen the foundation of the temple in order for it to withstand the forces of nature, we also need to take extraordinary measures—perhaps measures we have never before taken—to strengthen our own spiritual foundation in Jesus Christ. In his memorable message, he left us with two profound questions for personal reflection: “How firm is your foundation? And what reinforcements to your testimony and understanding of the gospel are needed?”\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ provides us with divinely inspired and effective means to prevent the spiritual erosion in our souls, powerfully reinforcing our foundation and helping us avoid gaps in our faith and instability in both our testimony and our understanding of the sacred truths of the gospel. One particularly relevant principle for achieving this purpose is found in section 12 of the Doctrine and Covenants, a revelation given through the Prophet Joseph Smith to Joseph Knight, a righteous man who earnestly sought to understand the Lord’s will, not for mere outward change but to stand unwavering in his discipleship—“firm as the pillars of heaven.” The Lord declared:\n“Behold, I speak unto you, and also to all those who have desires to bring forth and establish this work;\n“And no one can assist in this work except he shall be humble and full of love, having faith, hope, and charity, being temperate in all things, whatsoever shall be entrusted to his care.”\nThe Savior’s guidance, recorded in this sacred revelation, reminds us that temperance is an essential reinforcement for a firm foundation in Jesus Christ. It is one of the indispensable virtues, not only for those who have been called to serve but also for all who have made sacred covenants with the Lord and accept to follow Him faithfully. Temperance harmonizes and strengthens other Christlike attributes mentioned in this revelation: humility, faith, hope, charity, and the pure love that flows from Him. Furthermore, cultivating temperance is a meaningful way to protect our souls against the subtle yet constant spiritual erosion caused by worldly influences that can weaken our foundation in Jesus Christ.\nAmong the qualities that adorn true disciples of Christ, temperance stands out as a reflection of the Savior Himself, a precious fruit of the Spirit, available to all who open themselves to divine influence. It is the virtue that brings harmony to the heart, shaping desires and emotions with wisdom and calmness. In the scriptures, temperance is presented as an essential part of the progress in our spiritual journey, leading us toward patience, godliness, and compassion while refining our feelings, our words, and our actions.\nDisciples of Christ who strive to cultivate this Christlike attribute become increasingly humble and full of love. A serene strength arises in them, and they become better capable of restraining anger, nurturing patience, and treating others with tolerance, respect, and dignity, even when the winds of adversity blow fiercely. They strive not to act impulsively but choose to act with spiritual wisdom, guided by meekness and the gentle influence of the Holy Spirit. In this way, they become less vulnerable to spiritual erosion because, as the Apostle Paul taught, they know that they can do all things through Christ, who strengthens them even in the face of trials that could shake their testimony of Him.\nIn his Epistle to Titus, Paul conveyed sacred counsel regarding the qualifications of those who desire to represent the Savior and do His will with faith and dedication. He said they should be hospitable, sober, just, and holy—qualities that clearly reflect the influence of temperance.\nHowever, Paul warned that they should be “not selfwilled, not soon angry, … [and] no striker.” Such characteristics are contrary to the mind of the Savior and hinder true spiritual growth. In the scriptural context, “not selfwilled” is one who refuses to act with arrogance and pride; “not soon angry” is one who avoids the natural urge to become impatient and irritated; and “no striker” refers to one who rejects contentious, aggressive, and harsh behavior verbally, physically, and emotionally. As we strive to change our behavior with faith and humility, we can be firmly anchored to the solid rock of His grace and become pure and polished instruments in His holy hands.\n\nIn reflecting on the need to cultivate the virtue of temperance, I am reminded of the words of Hannah, the mother of the prophet Samuel—a woman of remarkable faith who, even after great trials, offered a song of gratitude to the Lord. She said, “Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.” Her song is more than a prayer—it is a self-addressed invitation to act with humility, self-control, and moderation. Hannah reminds us that true spiritual strength is not expressed in impulsive reactions or haughty words but in temperate, thoughtful attitudes aligned with the Lord’s wisdom.\nOftentimes, the world exalts behaviors born of aggressiveness, arrogance, impatience, and excessiveness, often justifying such attitudes by the pressures of daily life and the inclination toward validation and popularity. When we turn our gaze away from the virtue of temperance and ignore the gentle and moderating influence of the Holy Spirit in our way of acting and speaking, we easily fall into the enemy’s trap, which inevitably leads us to utter words and adopt attitudes we will deeply regret, whether in our social, family, or even ecclesiastical relationships. The gospel of Jesus Christ invites us to exercise this virtue especially in times of challenge, for it is precisely on these occasions that the true character of an individual is revealed. As Martin Luther King Jr. once said, “The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.”\nAs covenant people, we are called to live with our hearts firmly rooted in the sacred promises we have made to the Lord, carefully following the pattern He established through His perfect example. In return, He has promised, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my doctrine, and whoso buildeth upon this buildeth upon my rock, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against them.”The Savior’s ministry on earth was marked by the virtue of temperance in all aspects of His character. Through His perfect example, He taught us to “be patient in afflictions, revile not against those that revile.” As He taught that we should not give in to anger because of disputes and contentions, He declared, “Ye must repent, and become as a little child.” He also taught that all who desire to come unto Him with full purpose of heart must reconcile with those with whom they are angry or with those who have something against them. With a temperate attitude and a compassionate heart, He assured us that when we are treated with harshness, unkindness, disrespect, or disregard, His kindness will not depart from us, and the covenant of His peace shall not be removed from our lives.\nA few years ago, my wife and I had the sacred privilege of meeting with some faithful members of the Church in Mexico City. Many of them, either personally or through their loved ones, had endured indescribable trials, including kidnappings, homicides, and other heartbreaking tragedies.\nAs we looked into the faces of those Saints, we did not see anger, resentment, or a desire for revenge. Instead, we saw a quiet humility. Their countenances, though marked by sorrow, radiated a sincere longing for healing and comfort. Even though their hearts were broken by suffering, these Saints pressed forward with faith in Jesus Christ, choosing not to let their afflictions become gaps in their faith or cause instability in their testimony of the gospel.\nAt the conclusion of that sacred gathering, we greeted each one of them. Every handshake, every embrace became a quiet testimony that with the help of the Lord, we can choose to respond with temperance to the frustrations and challenges of life. Their quiet and unassuming example served as a tender invitation to walk the Savior’s path with temperance in all things. We felt as if we were in the presence of angels.\nJesus Christ, the greatest of all, suffered for us until He bled from every pore, yet He never allowed anger to inflame His heart, nor did aggressive, offensive, or profane words escape His lips, even amid such affliction. With perfect temperance and unmatched meekness, He did not think of Himself but of each of God’s children—past, present, and future. The Apostle Peter testified of Christ’s sublime attitude when he declared, “Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.” Even in the midst of His greatest agony, the Savior demonstrated perfect and divine temperance. He declared, “Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.”\nMy beloved brothers and sisters, I extend an earnest invitation to all of us to adorn our minds and hearts with the Christlike virtue of temperance as a sacred response to the prophetic call of our dear President Russell M. Nelson. As we strive with faith and diligence to weave temperance into our actions and words, I testify that we will strengthen and anchor our lives more securely upon the sure foundation of our Redeemer.\nI solemnly bear my testimony that the constant pursuit of temperance purifies our soul and sanctifies our heart before the Savior, gently drawing us nearer to Him and preparing us, with hope and peace, for that glorious day when we shall meet Him at His Second Coming. I share these sacred words in the name of our Savior, Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "Sisters and brothers, thank you for your faithful devotion in coming unto Jesus Christ during these challenging times. You are wonderful; you are beautiful; you are each a child of God. It is my prayer that we will recognize the influence of the Holy Ghost as we become and help one another become truly devoted disciples of Jesus Christ and feel of His joy as we worship in the house of the Lord.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson declared: “Now is the time for you and for me to prepare for the Second Coming of our Lord and Savior, Jesus the Christ. Now is the time for us to make our discipleship our highest priority. In a world filled with dizzying distractions, how can we do this?”\nHe provided the answer: “Regular worship in the temple will help us. In the house of the Lord, we focus on Jesus Christ. … We come to know Him. … Every sincere seeker of Jesus Christ will find Him in the temple.”\nSo how do we become and help one another become devoted disciples of Jesus Christ? We minister to the one. Ministering in the Savior’s way involves compassion, kindness, patience, and love without judgment. As we minister to the one, we invite the one to come unto Christ and to worship in the house of the Lord to receive of His redeeming power. In other words, we help one another become devoted disciples as we minister to the one in ways that lead to the house of the Lord.\nWe learn from Jesus Christ the power of ministering to the one with love and without judgment. You remember the Samaritan woman at the well. This woman may have felt unimportant, alone, discouraged, and unseen. She may have felt she did not belong. Throughout her life she had five husbands, and the man whom she was living with was not her husband. Others may have imposed unrighteous judgment without knowing her life’s circumstances. This may be one of the reasons she came to the well alone in the hottest part of the day. And yet, she was one of the first to whom Jesus Christ declared He was the Messiah. To Him, this woman was a daughter of God.\nJesus Christ taught that woman that through Him one can receive eternal life by partaking of the living water. He declared, “Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give … shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give … shall be … a well of water springing up into everlasting life.”\nThe woman of Samaria felt of the Savior’s love and received a witness through the Spirit that He is the Messiah. After this witness, she returned to the city and invited others to come and see, and many believed Jesus was “indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.” Christ ministered to the one with love; as a result, others became His devoted disciples.\nWe learn of the power of ministering to the one with compassion from Christ’s Apostles Peter and John. You remember a certain man, lame from birth, lay daily at the gate of the temple asking for money. This man may have felt unimportant, alone, discouraged, and unseen. He may have felt he did not belong.\n“Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have [I] give [unto] thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.”\nPeter took the man by his right hand and lifted him up, and the man was made whole. Immediately following the miracle, the man entered into the temple with Peter and John, “walking, and leaping, and praising God.” Peter and John ministered to the one in ways that led to the house of the Lord, and this man became Christ’s devoted disciple.\nMy friends, there have been moments in my life when I too have felt unimportant, alone, discouraged, and unseen. I have felt as if I did not belong. I was baptized and confirmed a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when I was 19 years old. One year later, I accepted the call to serve as a full-time missionary, but there was much I had not yet learned about Church history.\nEarly in my missionary service, I learned that there was a period when those of Black African descent were not allowed to enjoy all of the blessings of worshipping in the house of the Lord. Learning this for the first time brought feelings of anger, confusion, doubt, and fear. These feelings were so intense that my ability to recognize the Holy Ghost was lost for a season.\nFortunately, I had a wonderful missionary companion, Kevin Vick, who ministered to me with love, patience, and kindness. Each night as he witnessed my feelings of doubt and uncertainty, he would simply say to the younger Elder Johnson, “I love you.” After about two weeks, I allowed myself to feel of Kevin’s love. I gained the courage to pray to Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ. As I prayed, I was drawn to section 6 of the Doctrine and Covenants, verses 21–23, which states:\n“Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. … I am the light which shineth in darkness. …\n“… Cast your mind upon the night that you cried unto me in your heart, that you might know concerning the truth of these things.\n“Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater witness can you have than from God?”\nAs I read, I remembered. I remembered the day that I had fasted and prayed to know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God and that Joseph Smith is the Prophet of the Restoration. I remembered covenants made in the house of the Lord that connect me to Jesus Christ in such a personal and intimate way. I felt of the Savior’s love, His mercy, and His assurance that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is His kingdom upon the earth and is necessary to prepare us for His Second Coming. Because I remembered, I again was able to recognize the Holy Ghost and to understand more fully that Jesus is the Christ and I am His disciple.\nAt times we will have unanswered questions and feelings of being unimportant, discouraged, alone, and unseen. However, my friends, we must press forward with faith in Jesus Christ and remember His words:\n“Let not your heart be troubled.”\n“In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.”\nI am a witness to this reality and of the Savior’s promised blessing.\nSo what can we do to ensure our ministering to the one in the Savior’s way is most effective? Living the doctrine of Christ will help us. “Living the doctrine of Christ,” as President Nelson described, “can produce the most powerful virtuous cycle, creating spiritual momentum in our lives.\n“As we strive to live the higher laws of Jesus Christ, … the Savior lifts us above the pull of this fallen world by blessing us with greater charity, humility, generosity, kindness, self-discipline, peace, and rest.”\n“[This spiritual] momentum produced by living the doctrine of Christ,” Elder Dale G. Renlund explains, “not only powers the transformation of our divine nature into our eternal destiny but also motivates us to help [to minister to] others in appropriate ways.” Elder Renlund reminds us that “the Savior’s job is to heal [to make us whole]. Our job is to love—to love and minister in such a way that others are drawn to Jesus Christ.”\nOur ability to live the doctrine of Christ will be enhanced by daily studying the Book of Mormon and weekly partaking of the sacrament. President Nelson declared that the Book of Mormon “teaches the doctrine of Christ … [and] provides the fullest and [clearest] understanding of the Atonement of Jesus Christ to be found anywhere.” I love this book. And prayerfully partaking of the sacrament each week will increase our understanding of the Atonement of Jesus Christ and provide spiritual renewal, comfort, and the power of godliness in our lives. Remember, “in the ordinances [of the priesthood], the power of godliness is manifest,” and this power, which comes from Jesus Christ, strengthens our desire and our ability to minister to the one.\nMy study of the Book of Mormon and partaking of the sacrament minimizes feelings of discouragement, escalates my determination to minister to the one in the Savior’s way, and helps make discipleship my highest priority.\nMy friends, I promise that as we live the doctrine of Christ and minister to the one in ways that lead to the house of the Lord, we will press forward with faith in Jesus Christ even amid unanswered questions and feelings of being unimportant, alone, discouraged, and unseen. We will invite the one to come unto Jesus Christ and to worship in the house of the Lord to receive of His redeeming power and love. In the house of the Lord, we will “feel [the Savior’s] mercy. [We] will find answers to [our] most vexing questions. [And we] will better comprehend the joy of His gospel.” In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "Last June, a terrible accident occurred in the country of Lesotho in southern Africa. A small bus carrying 20 young women of the Maputsoe Branch of the Church and seven of their leaders was headed to the capital city, Maseru, for a gathering of young women from their district. As they traveled the two-lane highway in the morning hours, a car coming in the opposite direction, attempting to pass another vehicle, came into the lane occupied by the bus. There was no space or time to avoid a head-on collision, and within seconds the vehicles hit, rolled off the road, and burst into flames.\nIn all, 15 people died in the accident, including six young women, two Young Women leaders, and the branch president and his wife. Survivors, family members, and friends have expressed a range of emotions, including moments of anger, depression, and even guilt. Despite these feelings and unanswered questions, they have comforted one another and turned to God through sacred music, the scriptures, and prayer, where they have found solace. Seventeen-year-old survivor Setso’ana Selebeli testified, “Jesus Christ loves us and is with us, even though our hearts hurt.”\n\nA young woman and a leader who were hospitalized for burn treatments studied the Book of Mormon together. One said, “Lately we’ve been reading in Moroni, and Moroni says exactly what I’ve been feeling. … When he speaks, it’s like he’s saying, ‘You have to learn these words because they are written for you to help you pass through this.’”\n\nAt a joint funeral service for those who perished, Area Seventy Elder Siyabonga Mkhize counseled, “We should all turn to the Lord at this time and ask Him to comfort our hearts and … to soothe the pain that we feel.” The Young Women president from the neighboring Leribe Branch, Mampho Makura, urged: “Turn to the Lord, and find the strength to accept His will. Jesus Christ is ‘the author and finisher of our faith’ [Hebrews 12:2]. Don’t look away, but look to Him.”\nLook to Him. Her words echo the counsel of Alma to his son Helaman: “See that ye look to God and live.” Alma cited the experience of Lehi and his people with the Liahona as a type: “It is as easy to give heed to the word of Christ, which will point to you a straight course to eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers to give heed to this compass, which would point unto them a straight course to the promised land.” Alma said: “If they would look they might live. … And if we … look we may live forever.”\nOn another occasion, Alma cited the example of the brass serpent raised by Moses when the ancient Israelites were afflicted by fiery serpents. The Lord told Moses to make a figure of a serpent and lift it on a pole, with the promise “that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.” Alma explained that the brass figure was a type or symbol of Christ, who would be lifted up upon the cross. Many did look and live, but others were, in Alma’s words, “so hardened” that they simply would not look and perished.\nAlma asked:\n“If ye could be healed by merely casting about your eyes that ye might be healed, would ye not behold quickly, or would ye rather harden your hearts in unbelief, and be slothful, that ye would not cast about your eyes, that ye might perish?\n“… Then cast about your eyes and begin to believe in the Son of God, that he will come to redeem his people, and that he shall suffer and die to atone for their sins; and that he shall rise again from the dead, which shall bring to pass the resurrection, that all men shall stand before him, to be judged at the last and judgment day, according to their works.”\nOf course, the counsel “look to God and live” has meaning for us not only in eternity but also makes all the difference in the character and quality of our mortal lives. Remember the words of young Sister Selebeli in Lesotho already mentioned—“Jesus Christ loves us and is with us, even though our hearts hurt.”\nIt is in the nature of a fallen world—where the devil rages and where everyone is imperfect—that there will be disappointments and offenses, suffering and sorrow, failure and loss, persecution and injustice. It is only by looking to God that individuals, families, and even nations can flourish. President Russell M. Nelson taught, “Because the Savior, through His infinite Atonement, redeemed each of us from weakness, mistakes, and sin, and because He experienced every pain, worry, and burden you have ever had [see Alma 7:11–13], then as you truly repent and seek His help, you can rise above this present precarious world.”\nNo promise is repeated more often in Book of Mormon scripture than this: “Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence.” The lived experience of the Book of Mormon peoples over centuries demonstrates the truth of these words. “Prosper” meant enjoying the guidance and blessings of heaven in their lives. “Prosper” meant achieving levels of economic well-being that enabled them to marry, raise families, and minister to the needs of others. “Prospering” included the capacity to rise above hardship and trial. Through the grace of Christ, “all things work[ed] together for [their] good,” refined them, and deepened their relationship with Him.\nAlma explained that to look to God is to keep His commandments, cry unto Him continually for His support, counsel with Him in all your doings, and let your heart be full of thanks unto Him day and night. God’s commandments and counsel are found in the scriptures and the words of His servants. The principles and ideals laid out in “The Family: A Proclamation to the World” are a prime example. Another is the guidance found in the booklet. The Young Men and Young Women theme for this year is “Look unto Christ,” drawn from the Lord’s comforting direction to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery: “Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.” speaks to several of God’s most urgent commandments and standards and teaches how to look to the Lord in making good decisions. It is a guide not only for youth but for all of us.\nAs one very important example, has crucial guidance in the chapter titled “Your Body Is Sacred.” It instructs: “Treat your body—and others’ bodies—with respect. As you make decisions about your clothing, hairstyle, and appearance, ask yourself, ‘Am I honoring my body as a sacred gift from God?’”\nfurther states: “Keep sex and sexual feelings sacred. They should not be the subject of jokes or entertainment. Outside of marriage between a man and a woman, it is wrong to touch the private, sacred parts of another person’s body even if clothed. In your choices about what you do, look at, read, listen to, think about, post, or text, avoid anything that purposely arouses lustful emotions in others or yourself.”\nThis calls to mind President Nelson’s recent admonition:\n“Few things will complicate your life more quickly than violating this divine law [of chastity]. For those who have made covenants with God, immorality is one of the quickest ways to lose your testimony.\n“… The power to create life is the one privilege of godhood that Heavenly Father allows His mortal children to exercise. Thus, God set clear guidelines for the use of this living, divine power. Physical intimacy is only for a man and a woman who are married to each other.\n“Much of the world does not believe this, but public opinion is not the arbiter of truth. The Lord has declared that no unchaste person will attain the celestial kingdom. … If you have been unchaste, I plead with you to repent. Come unto Christ and receive His promise of complete forgiveness as you fully repent of your sins [see Isaiah 1:16–18; Doctrine and Covenants 58:42–43].”\nRemember that in the Book of Mormon promise, the opposite of prosperity was not poverty—it was being cut off from the presence of the Lord. His presence refers to the influence of His Spirit in one’s life. All are imbued with the Light of Christ as they come into the world. In addition, some act to be baptized and receive the gift and added light of the Holy Ghost. He brings inspiration and guidance, enhances and refines one’s native gifts and abilities, and helps to avoid evil influences, poor decisions, and dead ends.\nLike you, I know some who once enjoyed the gift of the Holy Ghost but who through failure to keep the commandments of God have lost that blessing. One in particular comes to mind whose membership in the Church had been withdrawn due to transgression. He said that his initial reaction was to feel offended. He felt judged by imperfect leaders. He knew his conduct had been wrong, but he rationalized it by pointing to the faults and failings of others. After a while, he began to feel comfortable in a lifestyle outside the Church without the obligation of callings and expectations of attending worship services and ministering to others.\nThis continued for some time, but he began to feel ever more keenly the absence of the Holy Spirit—God’s presence—in his life. By experience, he knew what it was like to have, day by day, the comfort, guidance, and confidence born of the Spirit, and he missed it. Finally, he did what was needed to repent and qualify once more for baptism of water and of the Spirit.\nThere seems to be no end to the different sources people look to for meaning, happiness, and help. Most are “looking beyond the mark.” But we need not be “children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine [or fashion].” In looking to God, we can find peace in difficulty, and our faith can continue to grow even in times of doubt and spiritual challenge. We can receive strength in the face of opposition and isolation. We can reconcile the ideal with the present reality. Truly, there is no other way than what God Himself has ordained: “Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.”\nLooking to God means that He is not just one of our priorities; it means, rather, that He is our one highest priority. I call to mind again that awful crash in Lesotho last June. From her hospital bed, one of the Young Women leaders who survived, who did not believe in God before joining the Church, said that her purpose is now to discover why her life was spared. “Constantly serving God is how I will come to an answer, if I come to an answer,” she stated. “I used to think that I love God, but now I really, really, really, really, really love Him. Now He is the [number-one] priority in my life.”\nI bear testimony of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, who in perfect unity of word, thought, purpose, and action are the one God, to whom we may look for all good things. I bear testimony of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, whence comes the power to fulfill this wonderful promise: “Look unto me, and endure to the end, and ye shall live; for unto him that endureth to the end will I give eternal life.” In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "Dear youth, what a beautiful conference session we are having! We have already heard three living Apostles of Jesus Christ. What a wonderful blessing! And we will still hear one more, Elder Henry B. Eyring. The spiritual feast continues!\nWhen I spoke last year, we learned how to face this world through David’s experience with Goliath. Remember the five stones? Today I am sharing an Old Testament story I read at your age which left me wanting to be like its protagonist. The Bible does not tell us her name, so we will call her the woman of Shunem because this is the name of her town.\n\nOne day the prophet Elisha was passing through Shunem, and we read that there “was a great woman; and she [invited] him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in … to eat bread.” I imagine the prophet Elisha was so happy with the invitation to eat at her house! He had already gone several times, when one day the woman said to her husband, “Now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God.”\nThe woman says, “Now, I perceive.” It seems she invited Elisha to her house without knowing he was the prophet; she received her testimony through the Holy Ghost by listening carefully to what Elisha said and taught. (Remember, there were no pictures at that time! So it was hard to recognize the prophet just by his face.)\n\nBut the story does not end there. One day the woman said to her husband, “Let us make a little chamber, … and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in.”\nThis faithful woman was willing to build a room in her house so that the prophet, passing through the city, would have a place to stay!\nToday we can learn a powerful lesson from this experience.\nThe Lord testified to the woman of Shunem that Elisha was a prophet of God, and she acted by opening her house to receive him.\nWe too can receive a personal testimony of God’s prophets today and open our hearts and minds—our house—to the message that our Heavenly Father has for us in these latter days.\nDear youth, I invite you to ask yourself this question: “Do I have a personal testimony of God’s living prophets?”\nLet’s start at the beginning.\nWhat is a prophet? A prophet is a man whom God has called to speak for Him. There are prophets on the earth today, just as there were in ancient times.\nProphets are seers and revelators. That means they can see what others cannot see, and they can prophesy of future events. They can also prepare us for calamities. Prophets receive commandments and revelations from the Lord. The ninth article of faith speaks of the continuing revelation in these last days. It says, “We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.”\nElder Gary E. Stevenson said, “The Lord continues to reveal His commandments and will to His prophets today because He desires to lead us to happiness in this life and to celestial glory in the next life.”\nProphets also proclaim the gospel and are inspired teachers and messengers of God to everyone on earth.\nEach member of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles is a prophet, seer, and revelator. Serving as a council under the Lord’s direction, they have the authority to declare and interpret doctrine and establish policy for His Church. They carefully pray and deliberate, for the decisions of these quorums must be unanimous. In this way, the Lord assures us that His will will be done.\nProphets testify of Christ—His existence, His ministry, and His divinity.\nLet us read some testimonies from prophets in the Book of Mormon.\nAbinadi proclaimed:\n“God himself shall come down among the children of men, and shall redeem his people.\n“And because he dwelleth in flesh he shall be called the Son of God.”\nSamuel the Lamanite also testified that Jesus Christ is “the Son of God, the Father of heaven and of earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning.”\nAnd the prophet Moroni said, “I have seen Jesus, and … he hath talked with me face to face.”\nWhen Christ visited the Nephites, one of the first things He did was call twelve Apostles. And He said to the people, “Blessed are ye if ye shall give heed unto the words of these twelve whom I have chosen.”\nNow, let me share a few words for parents or other family members raising children. The Lord Himself taught Adam and Eve the truths of the plan of salvation. And then He said to them, “I give unto you a commandment, to teach these things freely unto your children.”\nWhat does it mean to teach freely? It is learning the truths of the gospel, having a personal testimony of them, and sharing that knowledge with our children. It is promoting both formal and informal teaching moments. It is living according to that knowledge and testimony.\nThe Book of Mormon describes the 2,060 stripling warriors as “men of truth and soberness, for they had been taught to keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before him.” These young men faithfully obeyed Helaman, who at that time was their military leader and also their prophet, and they recognized that their mothers had filled their hearts with truth and faith.\nParents, in this world where there are many voices and sometimes much darkness, God Himself has commanded us to raise our children in light and truth. He entrusted us with the responsibility to teach our children the saving truths of the gospel. If we fail to do so, the world will not do it.\nDear young friends, I have an invitation for you: In the coming days, I invite you to kneel, open your hearts, and pray with faith to Heavenly Father, asking Him to confirm to you that His chosen prophet and apostles are His voice on the earth today.\nThe woman of Shunem taught us that we can have that testimony through the Holy Ghost. I promise you that once we know they are God’s anointed ones, our lives will be easier in spite of our ongoing challenges, as we will obey their voices with trust, faith, and hope. To listen to and obey the voice of the prophet is crucial to holding on to every good thing until the Second Coming of our Savior.\nThe world’s wickedness is growing, but the Church of Jesus Christ and His kingdom are stronger than ever. Zion is putting on its beautiful garments, and Christ’s throne will not fall. The Lord expects us to be strong in our testimonies, to be full of faith, and to repent daily. Our Savior, Jesus Christ, is counting on each of us to carry on His work.\nOnce, the Prophet Joseph Smith said, “Brethren, shall we not go on in so great a cause?” However, since my message is mainly for you, the youth, I would like to use the word youth instead of brethren. Ready?\n“[Youth], shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, [youth]; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad.”\nI am grateful for the guidance and consecrated efforts of the living prophets. I give you my solemn testimony that they are called by God to carry forth, establish, and lead His kingdom on earth today. And it will always be so. It will always be the Lord who chooses His servants. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "My dear brothers and sisters, I feel the love of the Lord as we meet together. I am humbled to speak with you. I pray that the Spirit will carry into your hearts what the Lord would have you hear, far beyond the words which I will speak.\nLong ago I sought to learn physics and mathematics in my college years. I felt overwhelmed. I began to feel that I was trying to learn something that was beyond me. The more I felt overwhelmed, the less I felt the strength to keep trying. My discouragement led me to feel that my efforts were almost fruitless. I began to think of quitting, of doing something easier.\nI felt weak. As I prayed, I felt the quiet assurance of the Lord. I felt Him say to my mind, “I am proving you, but I am also with you.”\nI did not know then all that those words meant. But I knew what to do—I went to work.\nBy pondering and working during the years that followed, I came to understand this message of encouragement in the scriptures: “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.”\nI learned that my struggle with physics was actually a gift from the Lord. He was teaching me that with His help, I could do things that seemed impossible if I had the faith that He would be there to help me. Through this gift, the Lord was working to prove and strengthen me.\nThe word prove has several meanings. To prove something is not simply to test it. It is to increase its strength. To prove a piece of steel is to place it under strain. Heat, weight, and pressure are added until its true nature is enhanced and revealed. The steel is not weakened by the proving. In fact, it becomes something that can be trusted, something strong enough to bear greater burdens.\nThe Lord proves us in much the same way to strengthen us. That proving does not come in moments of ease or comfort. It comes in moments when we feel stretched beyond what we thought we could bear. The Lord teaches that we are to continue to grow and never tire in our efforts, that we never give up, that we keep trying.\nWhen we continue to have faith in Jesus Christ—even when things might feel impossible to us at the moment—we become spiritually stronger. The sacred scriptural records emphasize this truth.\nThe prophet Moroni, for instance, was proved and strengthened in such a way. He lived his final years alone. He wrote that he had no friends, that his father had been killed, that his people had been destroyed. He was hunted by those who sought his life.\nYet Moroni did not despair. Instead, he engraved his testimony of Jesus Christ on plates for people he would not live to see, including the descendants of the people who desired to kill him. He wrote for us. He knew that some would mock his words. He knew that some would reject them. Yet he kept writing.\nIn his proving, Moroni’s faith was refined and strengthened. It became more pure. His words carry the power of one who endured faithfully to the end. We can feel that power as we read his testimony:\n“Now I, Moroni, write somewhat as seemeth me good; and I write unto my brethren, the Lamanites; and I would that they should know that more than four hundred and twenty years have passed away since the sign was given of the coming of Christ.\n“And I seal up these records, after I have spoken a few words by way of exhortation unto you.\n“Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts.\n“And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.\n“And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.”\nMoroni’s testimony was refined in loneliness, but it shines with light to guide all generations to seek our Father in Heaven and the Savior Jesus Christ.\nAnother Book of Mormon prophet, Jacob, was proved and strengthened as a child who experienced afflictions and much sorrow. But his father, Lehi, taught him God would bless him through his trials.\n“And behold, in thy childhood thou hast suffered afflictions and much sorrow, because of the rudeness of thy brethren.\n“Nevertheless, Jacob, my firstborn in the wilderness, thou knowest the greatness of God; and he shall consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain.\n“Wherefore, thy soul shall be blessed, and thou shalt dwell safely with thy brother, Nephi; and thy days shall be spent in the service of thy God. Wherefore, I know that thou art redeemed, because of the righteousness of thy Redeemer; for thou hast beheld that in the fulness of time he cometh to bring salvation unto men.”\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith experienced such proving and strengthening when he was in Liberty Jail. In the depths of his anguish, the Prophet Joseph cried out:\n“O God, where art thou? …\n“How long shall thy hand be stayed?”\nThe Lord saw in Joseph’s suffering the sanctifying effect of his enduring it well when He replied:\n“My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;\n“And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.”\nThe greatest example of proving and strengthening occurred through the Savior’s Atonement. He took upon Him the sins of the world. He bore our pains and our sorrows. He drank the bitter cup. He proved faithful in every moment.\nBecause of His glorious Atonement, Jesus Christ can strengthen us in our times of trial. He knows how to succor us because He has felt all the challenges that we will ever feel in mortality. “He will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people … that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.”\n\nWe learn that while in the Garden of Gethsemane, the Savior did ask the Father if the trial could pass over Him—but then He also said that if it was the Father’s will, then the Savior would do it. In other words, the Savior even took on doubt and uncertainty, but He had faith in His Heavenly Father.\nBrothers and sisters, your proving and strengthening may not look like Moroni’s or Jacob’s or the Prophet Joseph’s. But it will come. It may come quietly, through the trials of family life. It may come through illness or disappointment or grief or loneliness.\nI bear witness that these moments are not evidence that the Lord has abandoned you. Rather, they are evidence that He loves you enough to refine and strengthen you. He is making you strong enough to carry the weight of eternal life.\nIf we remain faithful in our service, the Lord will refine us. He will strengthen us. And one day we will look back and see that those very trials were evidence of His love. We will see that He was shaping us to be able to stand with Him in glory. As the Lord’s Apostle Paul stated at the end of his own life, “I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.”\nI testify that God knows you. He knows the trials you face. He is with you. He will not forsake you. I testify that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. He is our strength, our Redeemer, our hope. If we trust Him, He will make our spiritual power equal to every trial we are called to bear. I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "The Book of Mormon concludes with inspiring invitations from Moroni to “come unto Christ,” “be perfected in Him,” “deny [ourselves] of all ungodliness,” and “love God with all [our] might, mind and strength.” Interestingly, the final sentence of his instruction anticipates both the Resurrection and Final Judgment.\nHe said, “I soon go to rest in the paradise of God, until my spirit and body shall again reunite, and I am brought forth triumphant through the air, to meet you before the pleasing bar of the great Jehovah, the Eternal Judge of both quick and dead.”\nI am intrigued by Moroni’s use of the word “pleasing” to describe the Final Judgment. Other Book of Mormon prophets likewise describe the Judgment as a “glorious day” and one that we should “look forward [to] with an eye of faith.” Yet often when we anticipate Judgment Day, other prophetic descriptions come to mind, such as “shame and awful guilt,” “dread and fear,” and “endless misery.”\nI believe this stark contrast in language indicates that the doctrine of Christ enabled Moroni and other prophets to anticipate that great day with eager and hopeful anticipation instead of the fear they warned of for those not spiritually prepared. What did Moroni understand that you and I need to learn?\nI pray for the assistance of the Holy Ghost as we consider Heavenly Father’s plan of happiness and mercy, the Savior’s atoning role in the Father’s plan, and how we will “be accountable for [our] own sins in the day of judgment.”\n\nThe Father’s Plan of Happiness\n\nThe overarching purposes of the Father’s plan are to provide His spirit children with opportunities to receive a physical body, learn “good from evil” through mortal experience, grow spiritually, and progress eternally.\nWhat the Doctrine and Covenants refers to as “moral agency” is central in God’s plan to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of His sons and daughters. This essential principle also is described in the scriptures as agency and the freedom to choose and to act.\nThe term “moral agency” is instructive. Synonyms for the word “moral” include “good,” “honest,” and “virtuous.” Synonyms for the word “agency” include “action,” “activity,” and “work.” Hence, “moral agency” can be understood as the ability and privilege to choose and act for ourselves in ways that are good, honest, virtuous, and true.\nGod’s creations include both “things to act and things to be acted upon.” And moral agency is the divinely designed “power of independent action” that empowers us as God’s children to become agents to act and not simply objects to be acted upon.\nThe earth was created as a place whereon Heavenly Father’s children could be proved to see if they would “do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.” A primary purpose of the Creation and of our mortal existence is to provide us the opportunity to act and become what the Lord invites us to become.\nThe Lord instructed Enoch:\n“Behold these thy brethren; they are the workmanship of mine own hands, and I gave unto them their knowledge, in the day I created them; and in the Garden of Eden, gave I unto man his agency;\n“And unto thy brethren have I said, and also given commandment, that they should love one another, and that they should choose me, their Father.”\nThe fundamental purposes for the exercise of agency are to love one another and to choose God. And these two purposes align precisely with the first and second great commandments to love God with all our heart, soul, and mind and to love our neighbor as ourselves.\nConsider that we are commanded—not merely admonished or counseled but commanded—to use our agency to love one another and choose God. May I suggest that in the scriptures, the modifying word “moral” is not merely an adjective but perhaps also a divine directive about how our agency should be used.\nA familiar hymn is titled “Choose the Right” for a reason. We have not been blessed with moral agency to do whatever we want whenever we will. Rather, according to the Father’s plan, we have received moral agency to seek after and act in accordance with eternal truth. As “agents unto [ourselves],” we should engage anxiously in good causes, “do many things of [our] own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness.”\nThe eternal importance of moral agency is highlighted in the scriptural account of the premortal council. Lucifer rebelled against the Father’s plan for His children and sought to destroy the power of independent action. Significantly, the devil’s defiance was focused directly on the principle of moral agency.\nGod explained, “Wherefore, because … Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, … I caused that he should be cast down.”\nThe adversary’s selfish scheme was to strip away from God’s children the capacity to become “agents unto themselves” who could act in righteousness. His intent was to consign Heavenly Father’s children to be objects that could only be acted upon.\n\nDoing and Becoming\n\nPresident Dallin H. Oaks has emphasized that the gospel of Jesus Christ invites us both to know something and to become something through the righteous exercise of moral agency. He said:\n“Many Bible and modern scriptures speak of a final judgment at which all persons will be rewarded according to their deeds or works or the desires of their hearts. But other scriptures enlarge upon this by referring to our being judged by the condition we have achieved.\n“The prophet Nephi describes the Final Judgment in terms of what we have become: ‘And if their works have been filthiness they must needs be filthy; and if they be filthy it must needs be that they cannot dwell in the kingdom of God’ [1 Nephi 15:33; emphasis added]. Moroni declares, ‘He that is filthy shall be filthy still; and he that is righteous shall be righteous still’ [Mormon 9:14; emphasis added].”\nPresident Oaks continued: “From such teachings we conclude that the Final Judgment is not just an evaluation of a sum total of good and evil acts—what we have done. It is an acknowledgment of the final effect of our acts and thoughts—what we have become.”\n\nThe Savior’s Atonement\n\nOur works and desires alone do not and cannot save us. “After all we can do,” we are reconciled with God only through the mercy and grace available through the Savior’s infinite and eternal atoning sacrifice.\nAlma declared, “Begin to believe in the Son of God, that he will come to redeem his people, and that he shall suffer and die to atone for their sins; and that he shall rise again from the dead, which shall bring to pass the resurrection, that all men shall stand before him, to be judged at the last and judgment day, according to their works.”\n“We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.” How grateful we should be that our sins and wicked deeds will not stand as a testimony against us if we are truly “born again,” exercise faith in the Redeemer, repent with “sincerity of heart” and “real intent,” and “endure to the end.”\n\nGodly Fear\n\nMany of us may expect that our appearance before the bar of the Eternal Judge will be similar to a proceeding in a worldly court of law. A judge will preside. Evidence will be presented. A verdict will be rendered. And we likely will be uncertain and fearful until we learn the eventual outcome. But I believe such a characterization is inaccurate.\nDifferent from but related to the mortal fears we often experience is what the scriptures describe as “godly fear” or “the fear of the Lord.” Unlike worldly fear that causes alarm and anxiety, godly fear invites into our lives peace, assurance, and confidence.\nRighteous fear encompasses a deep feeling of reverence and awe for the Lord Jesus Christ, obedience to His commandments, and anticipation of the Final Judgment and justice at His hand. Godly fear grows out of a correct understanding of the divine nature and mission of the Redeemer, a willingness to submit our will to His will, and a knowledge that every man and woman will be accountable for his or her own mortal desires, thoughts, words, and acts in the Day of Judgment.\nThe fear of the Lord is not a reluctant apprehension about coming into His presence to be judged. Rather, it is the prospect of ultimately acknowledging about ourselves “things as they really are” and “as they really will be.”\nEvery person who has lived, who does now live, and who will yet live upon the earth “shall be brought to stand before the bar of God, to be judged of him according to [his or her] works whether they be good or whether they be evil.”\nIf our desires have been for righteousness and our works good—meaning we have exercised faith in Jesus Christ, made and kept covenants with God, and repented of our sins—then the judgment bar will be pleasing. As Enos declared, we will “stand before [the Redeemer]; then shall [we] see his face with pleasure.” And at the last day we will “be rewarded unto righteousness.”\nConversely, if our desires have been for evil and our works wicked, then the judgment bar will be a cause of dread. We will have “a perfect knowledge,” “a bright recollection,” and “a lively sense of [our] own guilt.” “We shall not dare to look up to our God; and we would fain be glad if we could command the rocks and the mountains to fall upon us to hide us from his presence.” And at the last day we will “have [our] reward of evil.”\nUltimately, then, we are our own judges. No one will need to tell us where to go. In the Lord’s presence, we will acknowledge what we have chosen to become in mortality and know for ourselves where we should be in eternity.\n\nPromise and Testimony\n\nUnderstanding that the Final Judgment can be pleasing is not a blessing reserved only for Moroni.\nAlma described promised blessings available to every devoted disciple of the Savior. He said:\n“The meaning of the word restoration is to bring back again evil for evil, or carnal for carnal, or devilish for devilish—good for that which is good; righteous for that which is righteous; just for that which is just; merciful for that which is merciful.\n“… Deal justly, judge righteously, and do good continually; and if ye do all these things then shall ye receive your reward; yea, ye shall have mercy restored unto you again; ye shall have justice restored unto you again; ye shall have a righteous judgment restored unto you again; and ye shall have good rewarded unto you again.”\nI joyfully witness that Jesus Christ is our living Savior. Alma’s promise is true and applicable to you and me—today, tomorrow, and for all eternity. I so testify in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "President Russell M. Nelson taught that if the Lord were speaking to us directly, the first thing He would make sure we understand is our true identity: we are children of God, children of the covenant, and disciples of Jesus Christ. Any other designation will ultimately let us down.\nI learned this for myself when my oldest son received his first cell phone. With great excitement, he began entering the names of his family and friends into his contacts. One day I noticed his mom was calling. On the screen appeared the name “Mother.” That was a sensible and dignified choice—and, I’ll admit, a sign of respect for the better parent in our home. Naturally, I got curious. What name had he given me?\nI scrolled through his contacts, assuming that if Wendi was “Mother,” I must be “Father.” Not there. I searched for “Dad.” Still nothing. My curiosity turned into mild concern. “Does he call me ‘Corey’?” No. In a last-ditch effort, I thought, “We’re soccer players—maybe he calls me ‘Pelé.’” Wishful thinking. Finally, I called his number myself, and two words popped up on his screen: “Not Mother”!\nBrothers and sisters, by which name are you called?\nJesus called His followers by many names: Disciples. Sons and daughters. Children of the prophets. Sheep. Friends. The light of the world. Saints. Each carries eternal significance and underscores a personal relationship with the Savior.\nBut among these names, one rises above the rest—the name of Christ. In the Book of Mormon, King Benjamin powerfully taught:\n“There is no other name given whereby salvation cometh; therefore, I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ. …\n“And it shall come to pass that whosoever doeth this shall be found at the right hand of God, for he shall know the name by which he is called; for he shall be called by the name of Christ.”\nThose who take upon themselves the name of Christ become His disciples and witnesses. In the book of Acts, we read that after the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, chosen witnesses were commanded to testify that whosoever believed in Jesus, was baptized, and received the Holy Ghost would receive a remission of sins. Those who received these sacred ordinances assembled with the Church, became disciples, and were called Christians. The Book of Mormon also describes believers in Christ as Christians and covenant people as “the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters.”\nWhat does it mean to be called by the name of Christ? It means making and keeping covenants, always remembering Him, keeping His commandments, and being “willing … to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things.” It means standing with prophets and apostles as they carry Christ’s message—with its doctrine, covenants, and ordinances—across the world. It also means serving others to relieve suffering, being a light, and bringing hope in Christ to all people. Of course, this is a lifelong pursuit. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that “this is a station to which no man ever arrived in a moment.”\nBecause the journey of discipleship takes time and effort built “line upon line, precept upon precept,” it’s easy to get caught up in worldly titles. These yield only temporary value and will never be enough on their own. Redemption and the things of eternity only “cometh in and through the Holy Messiah.” Therefore, following prophetic counsel to make discipleship a priority is both timely and wise, especially in an age of so many competing voices and influences. This was at the heart of King Benjamin’s counsel when he said, “I would that ye should remember to retain the name [of Christ] written always in your hearts, … that ye hear and know the voice by which ye shall be called, and also, the name by which he shall call you.”\n\nI’ve seen this in my own family. My great-grandfather Martin Gassner was changed forever because a humble branch president answered the Savior’s call. In Germany in 1909, times were tough and money was tight. Martin worked as a welder in a pipe manufacturing plant. By his own admission, most paydays ended in drinking, smoking, and buying rounds at the pub. His wife finally warned him that if he didn’t change, she would leave.\nOne day, Martin’s coworker met him on the way to the pub with a crumpled religious booklet in his hand. He had found it on the street and told Martin that he felt something different after reading the pamphlet entitled Was wissen Sie von den Mormonen?, or What Do You Know About the Mormons? I’m certain that title has changed.\nAn address stamped on the back was just legible enough to decipher where the church was located. It was a considerable distance away, but they were moved by what they read and decided to take the train that Sunday to investigate. When they arrived, they found that the address was not the church they expected but a funeral home. Martin hesitated—because, really, a church in a funeral home sounded a little too much like a package deal.\nBut upstairs, in a rented hall, they found a small group of Saints. A man invited them to testimony meeting. Martin was touched by the Spirit and was so impressed by the simple, fervent testimonies that he bore his testimony. And it was there, in that most unlikely place, that he said he already knew it must be true.\nAfterward the man introduced himself as the branch president and asked if they would return. Martin explained that he lived too far away and couldn’t afford the weekly trip. The branch president simply said, “Follow me.”\nThey walked a few blocks to a nearby factory where the branch president’s friend worked. After a short conversation, Martin and his friend were both offered jobs. Then the branch president led them to an apartment building and secured housing for their families.\nAll of this happened within two hours. Martin’s family moved the following week. Six months later they were baptized. The man once known as a hopeless drunk became so ardent in his new faith that people in town began calling him, perhaps not so affectionately, “the priest.”\nAs for the branch president, I cannot tell you his name—his identity has been lost to time. But I call him a disciple, ambassador, Christian, good Samaritan, and friend. His influence is still felt 116 years later, and I stand on the shoulders of his discipleship.\n\n“There is a saying that you can count the seeds in an apple, but you can’t count the apples that come from one seed.” The seed planted by the branch president has produced countless fruit. Little would he have known that 48 years later, several generations of Martin’s family on both sides of the veil would be sealed in the Bern Switzerland Temple.\nPerhaps the greatest sermons are the ones we never hear but those we see in the quiet, unassuming actions and deeds observed in the lives of ordinary people who, trying to be like Jesus, go about doing good. What this gracious branch president did was not part of a checklist. He was simply living the gospel as described in the book of Alma: “They did not send away any … that were hungry, or that were athirst, or that were sick, … they were liberal to all, both old and young, … both male and female.” And, a point we should not overlook, they did not send away any “whether out of the church or in the church.”\nThose who take upon themselves the name of Christ recognize, as Joseph Smith said, “A man filled with the love of God, is not content with blessing his family alone, but ranges through the whole world, anxious to bless the whole human race.”\nThis is how Jesus lived. In fact, He did so much that His disciples couldn’t write it all down. The Apostle John recorded, “There are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written.”\nLet us strive to follow Christ’s example, doing good and making discipleship a lifelong priority so that each time we interact with others, they will feel God’s love and the confirming power of the Holy Ghost. Then we may join my great-grandfather and millions of others who have declared, like the disciple Andrew, “We have found the Messias.”\nIn the end, our identity isn’t defined by the world. But our discipleship is defined by the ordinances we receive, the covenants we keep, and the love we show to God and neighbor by simply doing good. As President Nelson taught, we are indeed children of God, children of the covenant, disciples of Jesus Christ.\nI testify that Jesus Christ lives and has redeemed us. He is the One who said, “I have called thee by … name; thou art mine.” In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "A schoolteacher once taught that a whale—even though large—could not swallow a human because whales have small throats. A girl objected, “But Jonah was swallowed by a whale.” The teacher responded, “That’s impossible.” Still not convinced, the girl said, “Well, when I get to heaven, I will ask him.” The teacher sneered, “What if Jonah was a sinner and didn’t go to heaven?” The girl replied, “Then you can ask him.”\nWe laugh, but we should not miss the power Jonah’s story offers every “humble seeker of happiness,” especially those struggling.\nGod commanded Jonah to “go to Nineveh” to declare repentance. But Nineveh was ancient Israel’s brutal enemy—so Jonah promptly heads the exact opposite direction, by boat, to Tarshish. As he sails away from his calling, a ship-wrecking storm develops. Certain his disobedience is the cause, Jonah volunteers to be thrown overboard. This calms the raging sea, which saves his shipmates.\nMiraculously, Jonah escapes death when a “great fish” the Lord “prepared” swallows him. But he languishes in that unbelievably dark and putrid place for three days, until he’s finally spit out on dry ground. He then accepts his call to Nineveh. Yet, when the city repents and is spared destruction, Jonah resents the mercy shown his enemies. God patiently teaches Jonah that He loves and seeks to rescue all His children.\nStumbling more than once in his duties, Jonah provides a vivid testimony that in mortality, “all are fallen.” We don’t often speak of a testimony of the Fall. But having a doctrinal understanding and spiritual witness of why every single one of us struggles with moral, physical, and situational challenges is a great blessing. Here on earth, ugly weeds grow, even strong bones break, and all “come short of the glory of God.” But this mortal condition—a result of choices made by Adam and Eve—is essential to the very reason we exist: “that [we] might have joy”! As our first parents learned, only by tasting the bitterness and feeling the pain of a fallen world could we even conceive of, let alone enjoy, true happiness.\nA testimony of the Fall does not excuse sin or a lax approach in life’s duties, which always call for diligence, virtue, and accountability. But it should temper our frustrations when things just go wrong or we see a moral failing in a family member, friend, or leader. Too often things like this cause us to wallow in contentious criticism or resentment that robs our faith. But a firm testimony of the Fall can help us be more like God as described by Jonah, that is, “merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness” to all—including ourselves—in our unavoidably imperfect state.\nEven greater than manifesting the effects of the Fall, Jonah’s story powerfully directs us to Him who can deliver us from those effects. Jonah’s self-sacrifice to save his shipmates is Christlike indeed. And three times when Jesus is pressed for a miraculous sign of His divinity, He thunders that “there shall no sign be given … but the sign of Jonas [Jonah],” declaring that as Jonah was “three days and three nights in the whale’s belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.” As a symbol of the Savior’s sacrificial death and glorious Resurrection, Jonah may be flawed. But this is also what makes his personal witness of and commitment to Jesus Christ, offered in the belly of the whale, so poignant and inspiring.\nJonah’s cry is that of a good man in crisis, one largely of his own making. For a saint, when catastrophe is brought on by a regrettable habit, comment, or decision, despite so many other good intentions and earnest efforts of righteousness, it can be especially crushing and leave one feeling forsaken. But whatever the cause or degree of disaster we face, there is always dry ground for hope, healing, and happiness. Listen to Jonah:\n“I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord … ; out of the belly of hell cried I. …\n“For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; …\n“[And] I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.\n“The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.\n“I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; … yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption. …\n“When my soul fainted … I remembered the Lord: and my prayer came … into thine holy temple.\n“They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.\n“But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the Lord.”\nThough it was many years ago, I can tell you exactly where I was sitting and exactly what I was feeling when, deep in the belly of a personal hell, I discovered this scripture. For anyone today feeling like I did then—that you are cast off, sinking in deepest waters, with seaweed wrapped about your head and oceanic mountains crashing all around you—my plea, inspired by Jonah, is forsake not your own mercy. You have immediate access to divine help and healing despite your human flaws. This awe-inspiring mercy comes in and through Jesus Christ. Because He knows and loves you perfectly, He offers it to you as your “own,” meaning it is perfectly suited to you, designed to relieve your individual agonies and heal your particular pains. So, for heaven’s sake and yours, do not turn your back on that. Accept it. Start by refusing to listen to the “lying vanities” of the adversary, who would tempt you into thinking that relief is found in sailing away from your spiritual responsibilities. Instead, follow the lead of the repentant Jonah. Cry unto God. Turn to the temple. Cling to your covenants. Serve the Lord, His Church, and others with sacrifice and thanksgiving.\nDoing these things brings a vision of God’s special covenantal love for you—what the Hebrew Bible calls hesed. You will see and feel the power of God’s loyal, untiring, inexhaustible, and “tender mercies” that can make you “mighty … unto … deliverance” from any sin or any setback. Early and intense anguish may cloud that vision at first. But as you continue to “pay that that [you] have vowed,” such a vision will shine brighter and brighter in your soul. And with that vision you will not only find hope and healing, but, astonishingly, you will find joy, even in the midst of your crucible. President Russell M. Nelson taught us so very well: “When the focus of our lives is on God’s plan of salvation … and Jesus Christ and His gospel, we can feel joy regardless of what is happening—or not happening—in our lives. Joy comes from and because of Him.”\nWhether we are facing a deep, Jonah-like catastrophe or the everyday challenges of our imperfect world, the invitation is the same: Forsake not your own mercy. Look to the sign of Jonah, the living Christ, He who rose from His three-day grave having conquered all—for you. Turn to Him. Believe in Him. Serve Him. Smile. For in Him, and Him alone, is found the full and happy healing from the Fall, healing we all so urgently need and humbly seek. I testify this is true. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "A little over a year ago, I was released from my assignment in the Presidency of the Seventy, a change announced here at general conference. Because my name was read near those of General Authorities becoming emeritus, many assumed I was also finishing my time of service. After the conference, I received numerous messages of gratitude and good wishes for my next phase in life. Some even offered to buy my house in North Salt Lake. It was nice to see that I would be missed and also to know we will not have trouble selling our home when I am done. But I am not there yet.\nMy new assignment took Monica and me to beautiful Africa, where the Church is flourishing. It has been a blessing to serve among the faithful Saints in the Africa South Area and witness the Lord’s love for them. It’s inspiring to see generational families of all backgrounds, including many successful and well-educated Church members, dedicating their time and talents to serve others.\nAt the same time, given the region’s demographics, many people of modest means are joining the Church and transforming their lives through the blessings of tithing faithfulness and the educational opportunities offered by the Church. Programs such as Succeed in School, EnglishConnect, BYU–Pathway Worldwide, and the Perpetual Education Fund bless many lives, especially those of the rising generation.\nPresident James E. Faust once stated, “It has been said that this church does not necessarily attract great people but more often makes ordinary people great.”\nThe greatness of our Saints in Africa becomes even more evident as they face life’s challenges and the demands of a growing Church. They always approach it with a positive attitude. They embody well the well-known teaching from President Russell M. Nelson:\n“The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives.\n“When the focus of our lives is on God’s plan of salvation … and Jesus Christ and His gospel, we can feel joy regardless of what is happening—or not happening—in our lives.”\nThey find joy despite their challenges. They have learned that our relationship with the Savior enables us to approach difficulties with smiling faces and grateful hearts.\n\nLet me share some of my experiences with these faithful Saints who illustrate this principle, starting with Mozambique.\n\nMozambique\n\nA few months ago, I presided over a stake conference for a one-year-old stake that already had 10 units. More than 2,000 people filled the small chapel and three tents that were set outside. The stake president is 31 years old, his wife is 26, and they have two small children. He leads this growing and challenging stake with no complaints—only a smiling face and a grateful heart.\nIn an interview with the patriarch, I learned that his wife was seriously ill, and he struggled to provide for her care. After addressing the issue with the stake president, we gave her a priesthood blessing. I inquired of the patriarch how many patriarchal blessings he gives on average.\n“Eight to ten,” he said.\nI asked, “Per month?”\nHe replied, “Per week!” I counseled him that doing that many per weekend was not wise.\n“Elder Godoy,” he said, “they keep coming every week, including new members and many youths.” Again, no complaints—only a smiling face and a grateful heart.\nAfter the Saturday evening session of stake conference, on my way to the hotel, I noticed people buying food along the road late at night. I asked my driver why they were doing it when it was so dark rather than during the day. He responded that they were working during the day to have the money to do it later.\n“Oh, they were working today to eat tomorrow,” I said.\nBut he corrected me: “No, they were working during the day to eat tonight.” I had hoped our members might be in a better situation, but he confirmed that many faced similar challenges in that part of the country. The next morning, during our Sunday session and newly aware of their circumstances, I was even more moved by their smiling faces and grateful hearts.\n\nZambia\n\nOn the way to a Sunday meeting, the stake president and I saw a couple walking along the road with a baby and two small children. We stopped to offer them a ride. They were surprised and delighted. When I asked how far they needed to walk to the chapel, the father replied that it could take 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the children’s pace. They faced this journey back and forth, every Sunday, with no complaints—only smiling faces and grateful hearts.\n\nMalawi\n\nOne Sunday before a stake conference, I visited two branches using public schools as meetinghouses. I was shocked by the humble and modest conditions of the buildings, which lacked even some basic amenities. As I met a few members there, I was ready to apologize for the inadequate conditions of their meetinghouse, but they were happy to have a nearby place to gather, avoiding the usual long walk. Again, there were no complaints—only smiling faces and grateful hearts.\n\nZimbabwe\n\nFollowing a Saturday of leadership training, the stake president took me to Sunday services held in a rented house. There were 240 people in attendance. Then the bishop introduced 10 new members baptized that week. The congregation was spread across two small rooms, with some members also sitting outside the building, watching the meeting through windows and doors. There were no complaints—only smiling faces and grateful hearts.\n\nLesotho\n\nI visited this beautiful small country, also known as “the mountain kingdom,” to see a Church district preparing to become a stake. Following a Saturday of meetings, I attended Sunday services in one of their branches in a rented house. The sacramental room was overflowing, with people standing outside the door to participate. I told the branch president that he needed a bigger house. To my surprise, he informed me that this was only half of his membership. The other half would attend a second sacrament meeting after the second hour. Again, there were no complaints—only smiling faces and grateful hearts.\nI returned to Lesotho later due to a fatal traffic accident involving several of our youth, already mentioned by Elder D. Todd Christofferson earlier. When I visited the families and leaders, I expected a somber atmosphere. Instead, I encountered strong and resilient Saints who were coping with the situation in an uplifting and inspiring way.\n\nMpho Aniciah Nku, 14, a surviving accident victim in this picture, illustrated it well in her own words: “Trust in Jesus and always look unto Him, because through Him you’ll find peace, and He will help you in the healing process.”\nThese are just a few examples where we see their positive attitude because they center their lives in the gospel of Jesus Christ. They know where to find help and hope.\n\nThe Savior’s Healing Power\n\nWhy can the Savior succor them and us in any circumstances of our lives? The answer can be found in the scriptures:\n“And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind. …\n“… And he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, … that he may know … how to succor his people according to their infirmities.”\nAs Elder David A. Bednar taught, there is no physical pain, anguish, or weakness we can experience that the Savior does not know. “You and I in a moment of weakness may cry out, ‘No one understands [what I am going through]. …’ No human being, perhaps, knows. But the Son of God perfectly knows and understands.” And why? Because “He felt and bore our burdens before we ever did.”\nI conclude with my testimony of Christ’s words found in Matthew 11:\n“Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\n“Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\n“For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”\nJust like those Saints in Africa, I know this promise is true. It is true there, and it’s true everywhere. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "In 2018, at the University of Utah, a special professorship was created called the “Dr. Russell M. Nelson and Dantzel W. Nelson Presidential Chair in Cardiothoracic Surgery”—cardio, meaning “heart,” and thoracic, meaning “chest.” It honored President Nelson’s important work as a heart surgeon and the support he received from his late wife, Dantzel. This professorship was paid for by a fund designed to last into the future. The individual selected for this type of prestigious professorship receives recognition, salary support, and research funds.\n\nThe first surgeon chosen to hold the professorship was Dr. Craig H. Selzman, a skilled heart surgeon who is not a member of our church. At the ceremony to award this professorship to Dr. Selzman, many important guests were in attendance, including President Nelson and his wife Sister Wendy W. Nelson. During the meeting, President Nelson spoke modestly of his pioneering surgical career.\nThen Dr. Selzman shared what it meant to him to be appointed to this professorship. He related that four days earlier, after a long day in the operating room, he discovered that one of his patients needed to go back to surgery. He was tired and disappointed, knowing he would have to spend another night in the hospital.\n\nThis evening, Dr. Selzman had a life-changing conversation with himself. In the moment, he thought: “On Friday, I will be appointed to a professorship named after Dr. Nelson. He was always known as someone who kept his emotions in check, treated everyone with respect, and never lost his temper. Now that my name will be linked with his, I need to try to be more like him.” Dr. Selzman was already a very considerate surgeon. But he wanted to become even better.\nIn the past, his surgical team might have been aware of his fatigue and frustration because he may have let it show in his manner and tone of voice. But in the operating room that night, Dr. Selzman made a conscientious effort to be especially supportive and understanding of his team. He felt it made a difference and resolved to continue trying to be more like Dr. Nelson.\n\nFive years later, President Nelson donated his professional papers to the University of Utah. Dignitaries from the university came to formally thank President Nelson. During this event, Dr. Selzman spoke again. Referring to President Nelson’s initials, RMN, he said, “There is an ‘RMN’ ethos that now pervades the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery at the University of Utah.”\nIn frustrating situations, Dr. Selzman explained: “I do what we now teach our trainees to do—focus, get over it, and do the best you can. This ethos lives in us every day. We give lapel pins to every member of the division and each new trainee. At the bottom of the pin are the letters ‘RMN.’ The RMN ethos is foundational to our training; we teach it to everyone.” Dr. Selzman had intentionally improved his prior attitude and aspirations because his name was now linked to that of President Nelson.\nThis series of events involving Dr. Selzman caused me to ask myself: “How have I changed since I linked my name with the name of Jesus Christ? Have I adopted a Christlike ethos as a result? Have I genuinely tried to become better and more like Him?”\nIn Dr. Selzman’s experience, we can see at least five parallels to the process through which we take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ. Even though that process begins with baptism, it is not complete until we are more pure and holy and have become more like Him.\nThe first parallel is identification. Dr. Selzman’s appointment to the Nelson professorship linked his name to President Nelson’s, and Dr. Selzman began to identify with President Nelson. When we take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ, we link our name with His. We identify with Him. We gladly become known as Christian. We acknowledge the Savior and unapologetically stand up to be counted as His.\nClosely related to identification is another parallel—remembrance. When Dr. Selzman goes into his office, his eyes are drawn to the medallion he received when he was appointed to the Nelson professorship. This medallion reminds him daily of the RMN ethos. For us, partaking of the sacrament each week helps us remember Jesus Christ throughout the week. As we partake of the sacrament, we do so in remembrance of the price He paid to redeem us. We covenant anew to remember Him, recognize His greatness, and appreciate His goodness. We acknowledge repeatedly that it is only in and through His grace that we are saved from physical and spiritual death.\nRemembrance means that we follow the advice given by the Book of Mormon prophet Alma. We “let all [our] doings be unto the Lord, and whithersoever [we go, we] let it be in the Lord; … [we] let all [our] thoughts be directed unto the Lord; … [and we] let the affections of [our hearts] be placed upon the Lord forever.” Even when we are occupied with other matters, we remain mindful of Him, just as we remember our own names, regardless of what else we focus on.\nAn outgrowth of remembering what the Savior has done for us is a third parallel—emulation. Dr. Selzman began to emulate President Nelson and the RMN ethos. I believe that President Nelson’s ethos is simply a manifestation of his lifelong discipleship of Jesus Christ. For us, the more we identify with and remember Jesus Christ, the more we want to be like Him. As His disciples, we change for the better when we focus on Him, more so than when we focus on ourselves. We strive to become like Him and seek to be blessed with His attributes. We pray fervently to be filled with charity, the pure love of Christ.\nAs President Nelson taught in April: “As charity becomes part of our nature, we will lose the impulse to demean others. We will stop judging others. We will have charity for those from all walks of life. Charity towards all … is essential to our progress. Charity is the foundation of a godly character.” Alongside charity, we seek, “cultivate, … and expand” other spiritual gifts from the Savior, including integrity, patience, and diligence.\nEmulating Jesus Christ leads us to a fourth parallel—alignment with His purposes. We join Him in His work. As a surgeon, Dr. Nelson was known as a teacher, a healer, and a researcher. The lapel pin used in Dr. Selzman’s division emphasizes these endeavors, featuring the words teach, heal, and discover. For us, part of taking upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ involves willingly, intentionally, and enthusiastically aligning our goals with His. We join Him in His work when we “love, share, and invite.” We join Him in His work when we minister to others, especially the vulnerable and those who have been wounded, shattered, or crushed by their earthly experiences.\nSo we more fully take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ through identification, remembrance, emulation, and alignment. Doing these four leads us to a fifth parallel—empowerment. We access God’s power and blessings in our lives. The Nelson professorship provides Dr. Selzman recognition and support funds that he is using to change the culture in his division. He applies this “endowment of power” to help others. In a similar way, when we take upon ourselves the name of the Savior, our Heavenly Father blesses us with His power to help us fulfill our mission in mortality.\nAs we make additional covenants with God, we take upon ourselves more fully the name of Jesus Christ. Consequently, God blesses us with more of His power. As President Nelson taught: “Each person who makes covenants in baptismal fonts and in temples—and keeps them—has increased access to the power of Jesus Christ. … The reward for keeping covenants with God is heavenly power … that strengthens us to withstand our trials, temptations, and heartaches better.”\nWe become more spiritually receptive. We have more courage to confront seemingly impossible circumstances. We are strengthened more in our resolve to follow Jesus Christ. We more speedily repent and return to Him when we transgress. We become better at sharing His gospel with His power and authority. We help those in need while being less judgmental, far less judgmental. We retain a remission of our sins. We have greater peace, and we are more cheerful because we can always rejoice. His glory will be round about us, and His angels will have charge over us.\nThe Savior invites us, “Come unto the Father in my name, and in due time receive of his fulness.” I urge you to do this. Come unto our Heavenly Father. Take upon yourself the name of Jesus Christ. Identify with Him. Always remember Him. Strive to be like Him. Join Him in His work. Receive His power and blessings in your life. Etch His name in your heart, willingly and intentionally. This gives you “standing” before God and qualifies you for the Savior’s advocacy on your behalf. You will become an exalted inheritor in the kingdom of our Father in Heaven, a joint-heir with His Firstborn, our beloved Savior and Redeemer.\nHe lives. I absolutely know it. He loves you. He gave His life for you. He pleads with you to come unto the Father through Him. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "If you have ever visited my home state of Louisiana, you are probably familiar with many of our tasty dishes—gumbo, jambalaya, étouffée, and the list goes on and on.\nFrom time to time, I find myself feeling bold enough to cook one of those tasty recipes. The undocumented final step after mixing all the ingredients and following the detailed instructions is to do the final taste test and see if anything is missing. At that point, I can hear the Creole cooking legends whispering in my ears, “Put more Tony’s in it.” Tony’s is a Creole seasoning made in Opelousas, Louisiana, my hometown. It is often used as the “secret ingredient” to compensate for the imperfections made while following the recipe.\nMy wife, Michelle, and I had the honor to serve as mission leaders in Louisiana. We had a tradition of teaching the missionaries how to cook her special jambalaya recipe on their last night in the mission home before they returned to their families. In addition to their testimonies of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, our missionaries left the mission with an appreciation for recipes.\nA few months ago, I was browsing through the Church Media Library and saw a link to a collection of short videos called Restoration Conversations with President Russell M. Nelson. The title of one of the short videos in the list caught my attention and made me smile. It is called “Scriptures Are God’s Recipes for Happy Living.” I immediately clicked on that two-minute video and watched President Nelson teach a group of Primary kids a simple and powerful message about how to be happy. He taught: “If you’re making a cake, you follow the directions, don’t you? And you’ll get a good result every time, won’t you?”\nHe continued, speaking about turning 95 years old soon: “People say, ‘What do you eat? What’s your secret?’” He replied, “The secret’s called the scriptures. You might read them and try them.”\nWell, there we have it. The simple secret for happy living is to just follow God’s recipe as detailed in the scriptures. I call it the “Good News Recipe.”\nWhat do you do if something goes wrong when following the recipe? Well, embedded in the Good News Recipe is the “secret ingredient” to ensure you always get it right in the end. The answer is always Jesus Christ.\nI think we all have moments when we feel our ingredients are not good enough, or we struggle to follow the directions, or perhaps we do something out of order, or something happens that is out of our control, and so on.\nWhat’s the remedy? It’s simply to add more of what invites Jesus Christ into your life.\nSo, what might it look like to add more Jesus Christ into your life?\nWhile serving as mission president, I had the pleasure of meeting personally with each of our young missionaries every six weeks. During the one-on-one meeting, it was common for missionaries to seek guidance on how to improve the effectiveness of their companionships.\nOn one occasion, a missionary came into his personal interview and sat down. I could tell from his body language that something was weighing heavily on his mind. I asked, “Elder, what would you like to discuss today?” He went on to describe some of the challenges he was having with his companion and how it was affecting their ability to do missionary work. With tears in his eyes, he looked at me and asked, “President, what should I do?”\nIn that instance, I honestly didn’t know how to respond. After a brief moment, I asked him if it was OK for us to kneel together in prayer for guidance from the Spirit. He agreed, and we knelt together and prayed for inspiration.\nAfter the prayer, we continued kneeling for a short time and then sat in our chairs facing each other. I asked if we could read a scripture together. As we opened our scriptures, I paused and told him, “Elder, as we read this scripture, please ask yourself the following question: If I live these attributes, will it improve my companionship and our missionary work?”\nThen we opened Moroni 7:45 and read out loud: “And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.”\nThe elder then looked at me with tears in his eyes and said, “Yes, President, but that is hard to do.” I agreed and reminded him that he is a son of God with divine potential to do it together with the Lord.\nThen we briefly discussed the parable of the slope taught by Elder Clark G. Gilbert of the Seventy, which reminded us that we need to start where we are and, together with the Lord, move forward and upward in a positive direction. I could tell that he was still feeling a bit overwhelmed with the next steps, so I asked him to describe his understanding of the scripture “by small and simple things are great things brought to pass.” He went on to describe the concept that by doing small and simple things, great things can happen. I asked him to take a minute and identify two small and simple things he could do to be kind to his companion.\nAfter a few moments, he shared his thoughts. Then I asked him to take a minute and identify two small and simple things he could do to be patient with his companion. He almost immediately shared his two thoughts. It was clear that he had already been pondering this before our meeting. I invited him to take those few items to God in prayer and to ask for confirmation, direction, and inspiration on how to execute his plan with real intent. He agreed. As we concluded, I asked him to provide a brief update in his weekly letter.\nAs the next few weeks went by, I could see in his weekly letters that things were improving. Not only could I see that improvement in his weekly letters, but I could also see it in the weekly letters of his companion. During our next in-person interview, I saw a night-and-day difference in his countenance and spirit. I asked him, “So, Elder, is it true that ‘charity never faileth?’” He responded with a big smile, “Yes, and by small and simple things are great things brought to pass.”\nAs you follow the Good News Recipe for happy living, remember President Nelson’s teaching: “Whatever questions or problems you have, the answer is always found in the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. Learn more about His Atonement, His love, His mercy, His doctrine, and His restored gospel of healing and progression. Turn to Him! Follow Him!”\nWhen you need to “hear Him” and know how to invite Jesus Christ into your life, consider following the steps President Nelson taught us about personal revelation:\n“Find a quiet place where you can regularly go. Humble yourself before God. Pour out your heart to your Heavenly Father. Turn to Him for answers and for comfort.\n“Pray in the name of Jesus Christ about your concerns, your fears, your weaknesses—yes, the very longings of your heart. And then listen! Write the thoughts that come to your mind. Record your feelings and follow through with actions that you are prompted to take. As you repeat this process day after day, month after month, year after year, you will ‘grow into the principle of revelation.’”\nI testify that Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer. He has “accomplished everything we need to be able to return to [our] Heavenly Father.” In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "Can you remember a moment when someone gave you a gift that changed your life? This October marks 40 years since I received one of the greatest gifts in my life. While I was in high school, I noticed that one of our classmates had a light that was different from most of the other young people. I enjoyed being around him. One day he told me he was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Then he offered me a gift: a copy of the Book of Mormon. He invited me to read a few pages and meet with two friends who could answer my questions. Those friends were the missionaries.\nWhen I met with the missionaries, they taught me the doctrine of Christ and invited me to follow the prophet Moroni’s invitation: “When ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost” (Moroni 10:4).\nI read several pages of the Book of Mormon and prayed. Although I did not yet have a deep understanding of all the things that the missionaries were teaching me, I felt in my heart that what I was reading was good and came from God. I received the confirmation of Moroni’s promise: “And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things” (Moroni 10:5).\nAfter I was baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, some friends tried to convince me that I had made the wrong decision. But each time I faced such doubts or opposition, I received renewed confirmation through studying the scriptures and praying to stay true to the covenants I had entered into with God. Since then, the Book of Mormon has been my companion and has become an immeasurable treasure in my mortal journey.\nThe Book of Mormon is more than just a book. It is another testament of Jesus Christ, written by many ancient prophets through the spirit of prophecy and revelation.\nThe most significant event recorded in the Book of Mormon is the personal ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among the Nephites shortly after His Resurrection. The Book of Mormon “puts forth the doctrines of the gospel, outlines the plan of salvation, and tells men what they must do to gain peace in this life and eternal salvation in the life to come” (introduction to the Book of Mormon).\nThe first edition of the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ was published in a small town in the state of New York in March 1830. The Prophet Joseph Smith was only 23 years old when he completed the translation of the book in 1829. He translated almost the entire book in less than 75 days, and the printing process took about seven months.\nToday, approximately 80,000 full-time missionaries in more than 150 countries are serving as volunteers, dedicating their lives to bearing witness that the Book of Mormon is true and that it testifies of Jesus Christ.\nAt the most recent seminar for new mission leaders in June of this year, President Russell M. Nelson shared his powerful testimony of the Book of Mormon: “The Book of Mormon is … the word of God. It teaches the doctrine of Christ and explains more about the Savior’s Atonement than does any other book.”\nI would like to offer three suggestions that can help deepen our conversion to Jesus Christ through a study of the Book of Mormon:\n\n1. Be Diligent and Consistent in Your Daily Study\n\nLike Alma and the sons of Mosiah, we must “[search] the scriptures diligently, that [we] might know the word of God” and be strengthened in the truth (Alma 17:2).\nWhile serving as mission leaders in the Georgia Atlanta Mission, my wife and I encouraged every missionary to study the Book of Mormon for at least 30 minutes daily. That commitment increased our faith and helped us to seek and expect miracles.\nIt’s possible that after the mission we may not have the same amount of time available for daily scripture study, but I promise that if you sincerely prioritize studying the Book of Mormon prayerfully each day, you will find greater spiritual strength and confidence in the Lord and His promises.\n\n2. Make Your Study More Meaningful by Feasting upon the Words of Christ\n\nNephi taught, “Feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do” (2 Nephi 32:3).\nTo feast means more than just reading—it means savoring, pondering, and applying. As you study the Book of Mormon, consider ways to make your scripture study more meaningful. For example:\n\nUse study aids available in the Gospel Library app.\n\nIdentify eternal truths that help us understand God’s plan and lead us to make and keep covenants with our Heavenly Father.\n\nHighlight significant phrases and record your impressions to preserve what you have learned during your study.\n\nThe Book of Mormon has the power to answer questions of our souls. As Nephi said, we should “liken all scriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit and learning” (1 Nephi 19:23).\nAs we feast upon the words of Christ, they will open the door to revelation and show us what we need to do in the various circumstances of our life to draw closer to Him.\n\n3. Bear Your Testimony of the Truthfulness of the Book of Mormon\n\nJust as Lehi desired to share the fruit of the tree of life with his family (see 1 Nephi 8:12), when we gain a testimony of the Book of Mormon, we develop a desire to share the joy that comes from knowing the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\nOne of our missionaries, Sister Benson, who is attending with us this session, shared with me her desire to help her young brother. At that time, he was preparing to attend college and wasn’t sure about serving a mission. I felt impressed to invite Sister Benson to read the Book of Mormon during the first four months of her mission, marking her favorite verses, and then to send that copy to her brother.\nSister Benson sent the marked copy of the Book of Mormon and invited her brother to read from it each night. She later shared with me: “Before my mission, my brother wasn’t sure if he wanted to serve a full-time mission. Slowly, over time, as he read the Book of Mormon, he found increasing joy in his life and began to consider serving a mission.”\n\nTwo weeks before Sister Benson completed her mission, her brother received his mission call. He is now serving in the Mexico Tuxtla Gutiérrez Mission. Through the Book of Mormon, Elder Benson came to see his life with spiritual clarity, which led him to serve the Lord and trust that things would work out. That decision was a miracle—influenced by the power of the words of Christ.\nMy beloved brothers and sisters, I encourage each of you to deepen your study of the Book of Mormon. I know as we feast upon the words of Christ found in the Book of Mormon, the Spirit will help us understand eternal truths and share our testimonies with conviction with those whom the Lord has prepared to hear His message. The Lord said, “Mine elect hear my voice and harden not their hearts” (Doctrine and Covenants 29:7). I testify that those who ask God in faith will gain a testimony of the truth and divinity of the Book of Mormon by the power of the Holy Ghost. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

        "content": "My loving brothers and sisters, thank you for your prayers on my behalf. I have felt them.\n\nI.\n\nThe doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints centers on the family. Essential to our doctrine on the family is the temple. The ordinances received there enable us to return as eternal families to the presence of our Heavenly Father.\nAs of the April 2025 general conference, President Russell M. Nelson had announced the construction of 200 new temples. He loved to announce new temples at the conclusion of each general conference, and we all rejoiced with him. However, with the large number of temples now in the very earliest phases of planning and construction, it is appropriate that we slow down the announcement of new temples. Therefore, with the approval of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, we will not announce any new temples at this conference. We will now move forward in providing the ordinances of the temple to members of the Church throughout the world, including when and where to announce the construction of new temples.\nThe portion of my talk that I have just delivered was written after the death of our beloved President Russell M. Nelson. What now follows was written and approved weeks before, but it still represents my teachings, inspired by the Lord.\n\nII.\n\nThe family proclamation, announced 30 years ago, declares that “the family is ordained of God” and “is central to the Creator’s plan for the eternal destiny of His children.” It also declares “that God’s commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force.” And “we further declare that God has commanded that the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman, lawfully wedded as husband and wife.” As then-Elder Russell M. Nelson taught a Brigham Young University audience, the family is “pivotal to God’s plan. … In fact, a purpose of the plan is to exalt the family.”\nThe Church of Jesus Christ is sometimes known as a family-centered church. It is! Our relationship to God and the purpose of our mortal life are explained in terms of the family. The gospel of Jesus Christ is the plan of our Heavenly Father for the benefit of His spirit children. We can truly say that the gospel plan was first taught to us in the council of an eternal family, it is implemented through our mortal families, and its intended destiny is to exalt the children of God in eternal families.\n\nIII.\n\nDespite that doctrinal context, there is opposition. In the United States we are suffering from a deterioration in marriage and childbearing. For nearly a hundred years the proportion of households headed by married couples has declined, and so has the birthrate. The marriages and birthrates of our Church members are much more positive, but they have also declined significantly. It is vital that Latter-day Saints do not lose their understanding of the purpose of marriage and the value of children. That is the future for which we strive. “Exaltation is a family affair,” President Nelson has taught us. “Only through the saving ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ can families be exalted.”\nThe national declines in marriage and childbearing are understandable for historic reasons, but Latter-day Saint values and practices should improve—not follow—those trends.\nIn my boyhood 80 years ago, I lived on my grandparents’ farm in a setting where almost all that happened during the day was under the direction of the family. There was no television or other electronics to distract from family activities. In contrast, in today’s urban society, few members experience consistent family-centered activities. Urban living and modern transportation, organized entertainment, and high-speed communication have made it easy for youth to treat their homes as boardinghouses, where they sleep and take an occasional meal but where there is far less parental direction of their activities.\nParental influences have also been diluted by the way in which most current members of the Church earn a living. In times past, one of the great influences that unified families was the experience of struggling together in pursuit of a common goal—such as taming the wilderness or earning a living. The family was an organized and conducted unit of economic production. Today, most families are units of economic consumption, which do not require a high degree of family organization and cooperation.\n\nIV.\n\nAs parental influences diminish, Latter-day Saints still have a God-given responsibility to teach their children to prepare for our family destiny in eternity (see Doctrine and Covenants 68:25). Many of us must do this when not all of our families are traditional. Divorce, death, and separation are realities. I experienced that in the family in which I was raised.\n\nMy father died when I was seven years old, so my younger brother and sister and I were raised by a widowed mother. In the most difficult of situations, she pressed on. She was alone and broken, but with the Lord’s help, her powerful teaching of the doctrine of the restored Church guided us. How she prayed for heavenly assistance in raising her children, and she was blessed! We were raised in a happy home in which our deceased father was always a reality. She taught us that we had a father and she had a husband and we would always be a family because of their temple marriage. Our father was just away temporarily because the Lord had called him to a different work.\nI know that many other families are not so happy, but every single mother can teach of the love of a Heavenly Father and the eventual blessings of a temple marriage. You too can do this! Heavenly Father’s plan assures this possibility for everyone. We are all grateful for temple marriage and for the prospective blessings of being sealed as an eternal family. Like my mother, we love to quote Lehi’s promise to his son Jacob that God “shall consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain” (2 Nephi 2:2). That applies to every Latter-day Saint family, complete or currently incomplete. We are a family church.\nOur doctrine and our belief in eternal families strengthen and bond us. I will never forget the promise of my maternal Grandfather Harris, when we children were living on his farm near Payson, Utah. He gave me the tragic news that my father had died in faraway Denver, Colorado. I ran into the bedroom and knelt beside the bed, crying my heart out. Grandpa followed me and went to his knees beside me and said, “I will be your father.” That tender promise is a powerful example of what grandparents can do to fill in the gaps when families lose or are missing a member.\nParents, single or married—and others, like grandparents, who fill that role for children—are the master teachers. Their most effective teaching is by example. The family circle is the ideal place to demonstrate and learn eternal values, such as the importance of marriage and children, the purpose of life, and the true source of joy. It is also the best place to learn other essential lessons of life, such as kindness, forgiveness, self-control, and the value of education and honest work.\nOf course, many Church members have beloved family members who do not embrace gospel values and expectations. Such members need our love and patience. In relating to one another, we should remember that the perfection we seek is not limited to the stressful circumstances of mortality. The great teaching in Doctrine and Covenants 138:57–59 assures us that repentance and spiritual growth can continue in the spirit world that follows mortality. More important, as families unite to strengthen one another, we should all remember that the sins and inevitable shortcomings all of us experience in mortality can be forgiven through repentance because of the glorious and saving Atonement of Jesus Christ.\n\nV.\n\nOur Savior, Jesus Christ, is our ultimate role model. We will be blessed if we model our lives after His teachings and self-sacrifice. Following Christ and giving ourselves in service to one another is the best remedy for the selfishness and individualism that now seem to be so common.\nParents also have a duty to teach their children practical knowledge apart from gospel principles. Families unite when they do meaningful things together. Family gardens build family relationships. Happy family experiences strengthen family ties. Camping, sports activities, and other recreation are especially valuable to bond families. Families should organize family reunions to remember ancestors, which lead to the temple.\nParents should educate children in the basic skills of living, including working in the yard and home. Learning languages is a useful preparation for missionary service and modern life. The teachers of these subjects can be parents or grandparents or members of the extended family. Families flourish when they learn as a group and counsel together on all matters of concern to the family and its members.\nSome may say, “But we have no time for any of that.” To find time to do what is truly worthwhile, many parents will find that they can turn their family on if they all turn their technologies off. And parents, remember, what those children really want for dinner is time with you.\nGreat blessings come to families if they pray together, kneeling night and morning to offer thanks for blessings and to pray over common concerns. Families are also blessed as they worship together in Church services and in other devotional settings. Family bonds are also strengthened by family stories, creating family traditions, and sharing sacred experiences. President Spencer W. Kimball reminded us that “stories of inspiration from our own lives and those of our forebears … are powerful teaching tools.” They are often the best sources of inspiration for us and our posterity.\nI testify of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Only Begotten Son of God, our Eternal Father. He invites us to follow the covenant path that leads to a heavenly family reunion. The sealing powers of the priesthood, directed by the keys restored in the Kirtland Temple, bring families together for eternity (see Doctrine and Covenants 110:13–16). They are currently being exercised in a growing number of temples of the Lord throughout the world. This is real. Let us be part of it, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."
