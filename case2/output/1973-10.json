        "content": "My beloved brothers and sisters and friends who are listening by radio and television, may I now for a few moments make some comments about a condition which is of great concern to all of us today. I speak of the shocking lack of self-respect by so many individuals, as is evidenced by their dress, their manner, and engulfing waves of permissiveness which seem to be moving over the world like an avalanche.\nWe see among us so many who seem to be forsaking standards of decency or an understanding of the meaning of time-honored words which, since the beginning of time, have had real meaning to our forebears; words that have made for strength of character and righteousness and harmony and unity and peace in the world.\nThere are eternal words which, if understood and taught and practiced, would bring salvation to every man, woman, boy and girl who does now live or has lived or will yet live in the world.\nTo some it may seem old-fashioned to speak of virtue and chastity, honesty, morality, faith, character, but these are the qualities which have built great men and women and point the way by which one may find happiness in the living of today and eternal joy in the world to come. These are the qualities which are the anchors to our lives, in spite of the trials, the tragedies, the pestilences, and the cruelties of war which bring in their wake appalling destruction, hunger, and bloodshed.\nTo those who fail to heed the warnings of those who are striving to teach these principles and choose to go in the opposite course, they will eventually find themselves in the pitiable state which you are witnessing so often among us. The prophet Isaiah described the tragic result most dramatically when he repeated the words of God which came to him as he sought to fortify his people against the wickedness of the world, and I quote his words:\n“… Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, saith the Lord; and I will heal him. But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt. There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.” (Isa. 57:19–21.)\nOther prophets have declared likewise, so forcibly as to not be misunderstood, that “wickedness never was happiness.” (Alma 41:10.)\nAs I have prayerfully thought of the reasons why one chooses this course which is dramatically described by the prophet Isaiah—when one who has departed from the path which would have given him peace is like the troubled sea, casting up mire and dirt—it seems to me that it all results from the failure of the individual to have self-respect. Listen to these words of wisdom from those whose lives have been worthy of emulation and who have experienced the realities of the periods of time from which they speak. I quote:\n“Self-respect—that corner-stone of all virtue.”\n—Sir John Frederick William Herschel\nOthers have declared:\n“Self-respect is the noblest garment with which a man can clothe himself, the most elevating feeling with which the mind can be inspired.”\n—Samuel Smiles\n“Every man stamps his value on himself. The price we challenge for ourselves is given us by others.—Man is made great or little by his own will.”\n—Johann von Schiller\nA lovely mother in a nearby community wrote this to me, “I love America, I love my husband, I love my children, I love my God, and why is this possible? Because I truly love myself.”\nSuch are the fruits of self-respect. Conversely, when one does not have that love for himself of which this sister speaks, other consequences can be expected to follow. He ceases to love life. Or if he marries, he has lost his love for his wife and children—no love of home or respect for the country in which he lives, and eventually he has lost his love of God. Rebellion in the land, disorder and the lack of love in the family, children disobedient to parents, loss of contact with God, all because that person has lost all respect for himself.\nI recall an invitation I had to speak to men who, for the most part, had not been advanced in the Church because of their lack of desire or their lack of understanding of the importance of conforming to certain standards required for advancement. The subject on which I was to speak was “Who Am I?” As I pondered this subject and searched the word of God to prepare for this assignment, I immediately sensed that I was to talk about a subject that is of first importance to each of us as it was to those men among whom, no doubt, there were some who had not found themselves and lacked the basis of a solid foundation upon which to build their lives.\nThe rowdiness of children, the incorrigibility of adolescence are more often than not a bid for a kind of attention or popularity that physical and mental endowments do not invite. So the blasé girl and the unkempt boy are often but a reflection of an individual who is seeking, by superficial adornment or by abnormal conduct (in a strange way), to supply that indefinable quality they may think is charm—a clumsy attempt to draw attention by conduct which certainly reflects that inward frustration because of the lack of understanding of their true identity as a human being.\nWell, then, “Who am I?” Those lacking in that important understanding, and, consequently, in some degree [those] failing to hold themselves in the high esteem which they would have if they did understand, are lacking self-respect.\nMay I begin to answer that question by posing two questions from scriptural texts which should be impressed upon every soul.\nThe psalmist wrote: “What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.” (Ps. 8:4–5.)\nAnd the next is the question the Lord posed to Job: “Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding. … [of] when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?” (Job 38:4–7.)\nReduced to more simple language than the words of those questions from the scriptures, the prophets in these quotations are simply asking each of us, “Where did you come from? Why are you here?”\nA great psychologist, MacDougall, once said: “The first thing to be done to help a man to moral regeneration is to restore if possible his self-respect.” Also I recall the prayer of the old English weaver, “O God, help me to hold a high opinion of myself.” That should be the prayer of every soul; not an abnormally developed self-esteem that becomes haughtiness, conceit, or arrogance, but a righteous self-respect that might be defined as “belief in one’s own worth, worth to God, and worth to man.”\nNow, consider these answers to the searching questions which must be burned into the consciousness of all those who have strayed away or who have not arrived at a true evaluation of themselves in this world of chaos. In the limited time allotted me, I hope that in some measure my voice will be heard above the dismal dreariness of this troubled world.\nThe apostle Paul wrote: “Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?” (Heb. 12:9.)\nThis suggests that all who live upon the earth, who have fathers on earth, likewise have a father of their spirits. So did Moses and Aaron, as they fell upon their faces, cry out: “O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?” (Num. 16:22.)\nNote how they addressed the Lord, “… the God [Father] of the spirits of all flesh [mankind]. …”\nFrom the revelations through Abraham, we get a glimpse of who and what the spirit is:\n“Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones;\n“And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born.” (Abr. 3:22–23.)\nThere we are told that the Lord promised that those who were faithful in that premortal world would be added upon, by having a physical body in this second estate of this earth’s existence and, furthermore, if they would keep the commandments as God taught by the revelations, they would have “glory added upon their heads for ever and ever.” (Abr. 3:26.)\nNow, there are several precious truths in that scripture. First, we have a definition of what a spirit is, as it relates to our physical body. What did it look like in that premortal world (if we could see it apart from our mortal body)? A modern Latter-day prophet gives us an inspired answer:\n“… that which is spiritual being in the likeness of that which is temporal; and that which is temporal in the likeness of that which is spiritual; the spirit of man in the likeness of his person, as also the spirit of the beast, and every other creature which God has created.” (D&C 77:2.)\nThe next truth we learn from this scripture is that you and I, having been spirits and now having bodies, were among those who passed that first test and were given the privilege of coming to earth as mortal individuals. If we hadn’t passed that test, we wouldn’t be here with mortal bodies, but would have been denied this privilege and would have followed Satan or Lucifer, as he came to be known, as did one-third of the spirits created in that premortal existence who were deprived of the privilege of having mortal bodies. These are now among us, but only in their spiritual form, to make a further attempt to thwart the plan of salvation by which all who would obey would have the great glory of returning to God our Father who gave us life.\nSo the Old Testament prophets declared with respect to death: “Then shall the dust [meaning our mortal bodies] return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.” (Eccl. 12:7.)\nObviously we could not return to a place where we had never been, so we are talking about death as a process as miraculous as birth, by which we return to “our Father who art in heaven,” as the Master taught his disciples to pray.\nA further truth is clearly set forth in that scripture [Abr. 3:22–23], that many were chosen, as was Abraham, before they were born, as the Lord told Moses and also Jeremiah. This was made still more meaningful by the Latter-day prophet, Joseph Smith, who declared, “I believe that every person who is called to do an important work in the kingdom of God, was called to that work and foreordained to that work before the world was.” Then he added this, “I believe that I was foreordained to the work that I am called to do.” (See vol. 6, p. 364.)\nBut now there is a warning: Despite that calling which is spoken of in the scriptures as “foreordination,” we have another inspired declaration: “Behold, there are many called, but few are chosen. …” (D&C 121:34.)\nThis suggests that even though we have our free agency here, there are many who were foreordained before the world was, to a greater state than they have prepared themselves for here. Even though they might have been among the noble and great, from among whom the Father declared he would make his chosen leaders, they may fail of that calling here in mortality. Then the Lord poses this question: “… and why are they not chosen?” (D&C 121:34.)\nTwo answers were given—First, “Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world. …” And second, they “… aspire to the honors of men.” (D&C 121:35.)\nNow then, to make a summary of what I have just read, may I ask each of you again the question, “Who are you?” You are all the sons and daughters of God. Your spirits were created and lived as organized intelligences before the world was. You have been blessed to have a physical body because of your obedience to certain commandments in that premortal state. You are now born into a family to which you have come, into the nations through which you have come, as a reward for the kind of lives you lived before you came here and at a time in the world’s history, as the apostle Paul taught the men of Athens and as the Lord revealed to Moses, determined by the faithfulness of each of those who lived before this world was created.\nHear now the significant words of that powerful sermon to “The Unknown God” preached by the apostle Paul, to those who were ignorantly worshipping images of stone and brass and wood, and I quote:\n“God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;\n“And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth [now mark you this], and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;\n“That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us.” (Acts 17:24, 26–27.)\nHere then again we have the Lord making a further enlightening declaration to Moses as recorded in the Book of Deuteronomy:\n“When the most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.” (Deut. 32:8.)\nNow, mind you, this was said to the children of Israel before they had arrived in the “Promised Land,” which was to be the land of their inheritance.\nThen note this next verse: “For the Lord’s portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.” (Deut. 32:9.)\nIt would seem very clear, then, that those born to the lineage of Jacob, who was later to be called Israel, and his posterity, who were known as the children of Israel, were born into the most illustrious lineage of any of those who came upon the earth as mortal beings.\nAll these rewards were seemingly promised, or foreordained, before the world was. Surely these matters must have been determined by the kind of lives we had lived in that premortal spirit world. Some may question these assumptions, but at the same time they will accept without any question the belief that each one of us will be judged when we leave this earth according to his or her deeds during our lives here in mortality. Isn’t it just as reasonable to believe that what we have received here in this earth life was given to each of us according to the merits of our conduct before we came here?\nNow there is another important understanding that we have from the scriptures. We are all free agents, which means to some people who manifest a spirit of rebellion that they are free to do anything they please, but that is not the correct meaning of free agency as the prophets have declared in the scriptures where free agency has been defined. I quote:\n“Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great mediation of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.” (2 Ne. 2:27.)\nThe apostle Paul impressed the sacredness of our individual bodies in this statement: “Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.” (1 Cor. 3:16–17.)\nAnd, again, he said further to those who had been baptized members of the church that they had received the gift of a special endowment known as the Holy Ghost. This was his teaching: “What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? … therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.” (1 Cor. 6:19–20.)\nIf we can get a person to think what those words mean, then we can begin to understand the significance of the words of the renowned psychologist, MacDougall, from whom I have previously quoted, “The first thing to be done to help a man to moral regeneration is to restore, if possible, his self-respect.” How better may that self-respect be restored than to help him to fully understand the answer to that question, “Who am I?”\nWhen we see one devoid of respect for himself, as indicated by his conduct, his outward appearance, his speech, and his utter disregard of the basic measures of decency, then certainly we are witnessing the frightening aspect of one over whom Satan has achieved a victory, as the Lord declared he would try to do “to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will … to destroy the agency of man.” (See Moses 4:1–4.) This is the fate of “even as many as would not hearken unto my voice” (Moses 4:4), so declared the Lord to Moses.\nSome years ago I read a report from a survey made by ministers who had studied a number of cases of students who had committed suicide. This was their firm conclusion after an exhaustive study: “The philosophy of the students who took their lives was so lacking that when a severe crisis came in their lives, they had nothing to hold fast to, and so they took the coward’s way out.”\nSuch could be the awful state of those described by the Master in a parable with which he concluded the Sermon on the Mount:\n“And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:\n“And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.” (Matt. 7:26–27.)\nThe Lord’s eternal purpose with respect to his plan of salvation was declared to Moses: “For behold, this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.” (Moses 1:39.)\nThe first goal in that eternal plan was for each of us to come to earth and gain a physical body, and then, after death and the resurrection which would follow, the spirit and the resurrected body would not thereafter be subject to death. All of this was a free gift to every living soul as Paul declared: “For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.” (1 Cor. 15:22.)\nWhat this means to one dying with a malignant malady or to a mother bereft of a child may be illustrated by the expressions of a young mother whom I visited in the hospital some years ago. She said to me, “I have thought all this through. It doesn’t make any difference whether I go now or whether I live to 70, 80, or 90. The sooner I can get to a place where I can be active and doing things that will bring me eternal joy the better for all concerned.” She was comforted by the thought that she had lived such a life as to be worthy to enter into the presence of God, which is to enjoy eternal life.\nThe importance of taking advantage of every hour of precious time allotted to each of us here was impressed forcibly upon me by an incident in my own family. A young mother came with her beautiful flaxen-haired six-year-old daughter to her grandparents. The mother asked if we would like to hear a beautiful new children’s song which the daughter had just learned in her Primary class. While the little mother accompanied her, she sang:\n\n“I am a child of God,\nAnd he has sent me here,\nHas given me an earthly home\nWith parents kind and dear.\n\n“I am a child of God,\nAnd so my needs are great;\nHelp me to understand His words\nBefore it grows too late.\n\n“I am a child of God,\nRich blessings are in store;\nIf I but learn to do His will\nI’ll live with him once more.\n\n(Chorus)\n“Lead me, guide me, walk beside me,\nHelp me find the way.\nTeach me all that I must do\nTo live with him some day.”\n\n— no. B-76\n\nHer grandparents were in tears. Little did they know then, that hardly before that little girl would have had the full opportunity for her mother to teach her all that she should know in order to return to her heavenly home, that the little mother would be suddenly taken away in death, leaving to others the responsibility of finding the answer to the pleadings of that childhood prayer, to teach and train and to lead her through the uncertainties of life.\nWhat a difference it would make if we really sensed our divine relationship to God, our Heavenly Father, our relationship to Jesus Christ, our Savior and our elder brother, and our relationship to each other.\nContrasted with the sublime peace to one such as that wonderful sister I visited in the hospital is that terrifying state of those who do not, as they approach death, have that great comfort, for as the Lord has told us plainly: “And they that die not in me, wo unto them, for their death is bitter.” (D&C 42:47.)\nIt was George Bernard Shaw who said, “If we all realized that we were the children of one father, we would stop shouting at each other as much as we do.”\nNow, as I come to the closing of this address, I trust that I might have given to you and others who have not yet listened to such counsel, something to stimulate some sober thinking as to who you are and from whence you came; and, in so doing, that I may have stirred up within your soul the determination to begin now to show an increased self-respect and reverence for the temple of God, your human body, wherein dwells a heavenly spirit. I would charge you to say again and again to yourselves, as the Primary organization has taught the children to sing “I am a [son or a daughter] of God” and by so doing, begin today to live closer to those ideals which will make your life happier and more fruitful because of an awakened realization of who you are.\nGod grant that each of us here today may so live that all among us, and with us, may see, not us, but that which is divine and comes from God. With that vision of what those who have lost their way may become, my prayer is that they may receive strength and resolution to climb higher and higher and upward and onward to that great goal of eternal life and also that I may do my part in seeking to show by example, as well as by precept, that which will be the best of which I am capable of doing.\nI again bear my solemn witness to the great truth of the Master’s profound words to the sobbing Martha: “I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.” (John 11:25.)\nI thank God that I too can say, with the same spirit as did Martha, who bore her testimony as the Spirit witnessed to her from the depths of her soul:\n“Yea, Lord: I [too know] that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which [came] into the world.” (See John 11:27.)\nIn the name of our Lord and Master, Jesus, the Christ, the Savior of the world, even so. Amen."

        "content": "I thrill with you, brethren and sisters, as we have listened this morning to a prophet’s voice and heard the word of God; and I pray that the Lord will continue to sustain his mouthpiece on the earth for the blessing of all of his children throughout the world.\nOne young mother once said to me, “It seems in our home we go from one crisis to another. We never seem to be in calm waters. Either it’s sick children, a Primary lesson to prepare, a car that breaks down before meetings, a flooded bathroom—you name it, we’ve had it.”\nI suppose there are many of us whose life pattern would echo that refrain, even though the experiences will vary with each of us.\nBecause of the countless problems surrounding us and because of the trials and tribulations we are all confronted with, I’ve felt a need to be built up again in our understanding—of why we have adversity and what we can do—to weather its storm. It seems that life is filled with a variety of difficult experiences that test us and try us.\nWe should understand that a life filled with problems is no respecter of age or station in life. A life filled with trials is no respecter of position in the Church or social standing in the community. Challenges come to the young and to the aged—to the rich and to the poor—to the struggling student or the genius scientist—to the farmer, carpenter, lawyer, or doctor. Trials come to the strong and to the weak—to the sick and to the healthy. Yes, even to the simplest child as well as to a prophet of God. At times they seem to be more than we can bear.\nNow, some will say, “Why would a Father in heaven who calls us his children—who says he loves us above all of his creations—who says he wants only the best for us—who wants us to be happy and enjoy life to the fullest—why does he let these things happen to us—if we are really that dear to him?” The scriptures and the prophets have some needed answers for us:\nWe read in Helaman: “And thus we see that except the Lord doth chasten his people with many afflictions, yea, except he doth visit them with death and with terror, and with famine and with all manner of pestilence, they will not remember him.” (Hel. 12:3.)\nAt a recent stake conference the stake president called a young father, who had just been ordained an elder, from the audience to bear his testimony. The father had been active in the Church as a boy, but during his teenage years had veered somewhat from his childhood pattern. After returning from the military service he married a lovely girl and presently children blessed their home. Without warning an undisclosed illness overcame their little four-year-old daughter. Within a very short time she was on the critical list in the hospital. In desperation and for the first time in many years the father went to his knees in prayer—asking that her life be spared. As her condition worsened and he sensed that she would not live, the tone of the father’s prayers changed—he no longer asked that her life be spared—but rather for a blessing of understanding—“Let thy will be done,” he said. Soon the child was in a coma, indicating her hours on earth were few. Now, fortified with understanding and trust, the young parents asked for one more favor of the Lord. Would he allow her to awaken once more that they might hold her closely. The little one’s eyes opened, her frail arms outstretched to her mother and then to her daddy for a final embrace. When the father laid her on the pillow to sleep till another morning, he knew their prayers had been answered—a kind, understanding Father in heaven had filled their needs as he knew them to be. His will had been done—they had gained understanding—they were determined now to live that they might live again with her.\nDo you remember the words of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith when he was having that great test of his faith in the Liberty Jail? The Lord said, “If thou art called to pass through tribulation …” and then the Lord called to mind a series of possibilities that would test any man to the utmost—and he then concluded: “Know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience and shall be for thy good.” (D&C 122:5, 7.)\nIt’s interesting to note that from the depths of trial and despair have come some of the most beautiful and classic passages of modern-day scripture—not from the ease of a comfortable circumstance. Might this also be the case in our own lives! From trial comes refined beauty.\nWe could cite Beethoven or Abraham Lincoln or Demosthenes who won out in a most difficult struggle to become a magnificent orator—but closer to us we see the great beauty and wisdom in the speaking and teaching of President Spencer W. Kimball and we see the price he’s paid that our lives might be blessed.\nIn speaking of the Savior, the scriptures tell us: “Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.” (Heb. 5:8.)\nFrom Hebrews we also read: “My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him: for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.” (Heb. 12:5.)\nLet us remember—trials are an evidence of a Father’s love. They are given as a blessing to his children. They are given as opportunities for growth.\nNow, how do we approach them? How do we overcome them? How are we magnified by them? There seems to be a reason why we lose our composure in adversity—why we think we can no longer cope with what we’re faced with here in this life. There is a reason why we give up, why we “fall apart at the seams” so to speak. The reason may be so simple that we lose sight of it.\nCould it be it’s because we begin to lose contact with our greatest source of strength—our Father in heaven? He is the key to our enjoying sweetness in adversity—in gaining strength from our trials—he and he alone.\nAs a reassurance to us, let us read from the New Testament: “There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.” (1 Cor. 10:13.)\nDid you get the significance of that scriptural promise—we will have no temptation or trial beyond our ability to overcome—he will provide a way for us to rise above—whatever it may be.\nMay I suggest the best way I know to keep close to the source of this great strength is through prayer. No man can stand alone in his struggle through life. Sometimes in discouragement our prayers, at best, become occasional or maybe not at all. Sometimes we forget or just don’t care. Brigham Young once said, “Prayer keeps man from sin, and sin keeps man from prayer.”\nSome may be thinking that because they have a Word of Wisdom problem or because they have been dishonest or immoral—because they have not prayed for years—because of any reasons they now feel unworthy—they may say, “It’s too late, I’ve made so many mistakes—so why even try?” To these we say, “For your own sake, give yourself another chance.”\nSincere prayer is the heart of a happy and productive life. Prayer strengthens faith. Prayer is the preparation for miracles. Prayer opens the door to eternal happiness. The Father of us all is personal, ever waiting to hear from us, as any loving father would his children. To learn to communicate with him, to learn to pray effectively, requires diligence and dedication and desire on our part. I wonder sometimes if we are willing to pay the price for an answer from the Lord.\nAs we learn to develop this two-way communication, the standard of our life will improve. We will see things more clearly, we will try harder to do better, we will see the real joy that can come through trials and testing. Although problems will still be with us, peace, contentment, and true happiness will be ours in abundance.\nAs you feel the need to confide in the Lord or to improve the quality of your visits with him—to pray, if you please—may I suggest a process to follow: go where you can be alone, go where you can think, go where you can kneel, go where you can speak out loud to him. The bedroom, the bathroom, or the closet will do. Now, picture him in your mind’s eye. Think to whom you are speaking, control your thoughts—don’t let them wander, address him as your Father and your friend. Now tell him things you really feel to tell him—not trite phrases that have little meaning, but have a sincere, heartfelt conversation with him. Confide in him, ask him for forgiveness, plead with him, enjoy him, thank him, express your love to him, and then listen for his answers. Listening is an essential part of praying. Answers from the Lord come quietly—ever so quietly. In fact, few hear his answers audibly with their ears. We must be listening so carefully or we will never recognize them. Most answers from the Lord are felt in our heart as a warm comfortable expression, or they may come as thoughts to our mind. They come to those who are prepared and who are patient.\nYes, the trials will still be there; but with the companionship of the Spirit, our approach to trials will change frustrations and heartaches to blessings.\nJust for a moment, think with me. Forget the trials you now have. Remember back to those trials you had last year, five years ago, ten years ago. What did you gain? What did you learn? Aren’t you better prepared now because of them?\nI testify he is ready and waiting to help us. For our own good we must take the first step and this step is prayer. I know he lives, brothers and sisters, I know Jesus is the Christ. I know he established his church here for our blessing. I know his mouthpiece is before us this morning, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "After a meeting with a group of students recently one young man waited to ask a question. “Elder Hanks,” he said, “what are your goals? What do you want to accomplish?” I observed his seriousness of purpose and answered in the same spirit that my strongest desire is to qualify to be a friend of Christ.\nI had not responded to such a question just that way before, but the answer did put into words the deep yearnings of my heart.\nIn ancient times Abraham was called the “friend of God.” Jesus, shortly before his crucifixion, said to his disciples, “Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. Henceforth I call you not servants … but I have called you friends. …” (John 15:14–15.)\nIn 1832, to a group of elders returning from missionary service, he repeated the message: “… from henceforth I shall call you friends. …” (D&C 84:77.)\nToday I would like to speak of one lesson among many that he taught us and that you and I must learn if we are to merit his friendship.\nChrist’s love was so pure that he gave his life for us: “Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.” (John 15:13.) But there was another gift he bestowed while he was on the cross, a gift that further measured the magnitude of his great love: he forgave, and asked his Father to forgive, those who persecuted and crucified him.\nWas this act of forgiveness less difficult than sacrificing his mortal life? Was it less a test of his love? I do not know the answer. But I have felt that the ultimate form of love for God and men is forgiveness.\nHe met the test. What of us? Perhaps we shall not be called upon to give our lives for our friends or our faith (though perhaps some shall), but it is certain that every one of us has and will have occasion to confront the other challenge. What will we do with it? What are we doing with it?\nSomeone has written: “… the withholding of love is the negation of the spirit of Christ, the proof that we never knew him, that for us he lived in vain. It means that he suggested nothing in all our thoughts, that he inspired nothing in all our lives, that we were not once near enough to him to be seized with the spell of his compassion for the world.”\nChrist’s example and instructions to his friends are clear. He forgave, and he said: “… Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.” (Matt. 5:44.)\nWhat is our response when we are offended, misunderstood, unfairly or unkindly treated, or sinned against, made an offender for a word, falsely accused, passed over, hurt by those we love, our offerings rejected? Do we resent, become bitter, hold a grudge? Or do we resolve the problem if we can, forgive, and rid ourselves of the burden?\nThe nature of our response to such situations may well determine the nature and quality of our lives, here and eternally. A courageous friend, her faith refined by many afflictions, said to me only hours ago, “Humiliation must come before exaltation.”\nIt is required of us to forgive. Our salvation depends upon it. In a revelation given in 1831 the Lord said:\n“My disciples, in days of old, sought occasion against one another and forgave not one another in their hearts; and for this evil they were afflicted and sorely chastened.\n“Wherefore, I say unto you, that ye ought to forgive one another; for he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin.\n“I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men.” (D&C 64:8–10.)\nTherefore, Jesus taught us to pray, “And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.” (See Matt. 6:14–15.)\nDoes it not seem a supreme impudence to ask and expect God to forgive when we do not forgive?—openly? and “in our hearts”?\nThe Lord affirms in the Book of Mormon that we bring ourselves under condemnation if we do not forgive. (See Mosiah 26:30–31.)\nBut not only our eternal salvation depends upon our willingness and capacity to forgive wrongs committed against us. Our joy and satisfaction in this life, and our true freedom, depend upon our doing so. When Christ bade us turn the other cheek, walk the second mile, give our cloak to him who takes our coat, was it to be chiefly out of consideration for the bully, the brute, the thief? Or was it to relieve the one aggrieved of the destructive burden that resentment and anger lay upon us?\n\nPaul wrote to the Romans that nothing “shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Rom. 8:39.)\nI am sure this is true. I bear testimony that this is true. But it is also true that we can separate ourselves from his spirit. In Isaiah it is written: “… your iniquities have separated between you and your God. …” (Isa. 59:2.) Again, “… they have rewarded evil unto themselves.” (Isa. 3:9.)\nThrough Helaman we learn that “whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it unto himself …” (Hel. 14:30); and from Benjamin, “… ye do withdraw yourselves from the Spirit of the Lord. …” (Mosiah 2:36.)\nIn every case of sin this is true. Envy, arrogance, unrighteous dominion—these canker the soul of one who is guilty of them. It is true also if we fail to forgive. Even if it appears that another may be deserving of our resentment or hatred, none of us can afford to pay the price of resenting or hating, because of what it does to us. If we have felt the gnawing, mordant inroads of these emotions, we know the harm we suffer.\nSo Paul taught the Corinthians that they must “see that none render evil for evil unto any man. …” (1 Thes. 5:15.)\nIt is reported that President Brigham Young once said that he who takes offense when no offense was intended is a fool, and he who takes offense when offense was intended is usually a fool. It was then explained that there are two courses of action to follow when one is bitten by a rattlesnake. One may, in anger, fear, or vengefulness, pursue the creature and kill it. Or he may make full haste to get the venom out of his system. If we pursue the latter course we will likely survive, but if we attempt to follow the former, we may not be around long enough to finish it.\nYears ago on Temple Square I heard a boy pour out the anguish of his troubled heart and make a commitment to God. He had been living in a spirit of hatred toward a man who had criminally taken the life of his father. Nearly bereft of his senses with grief, he had been overcome with bitterness.\nOn that Sabbath morning when others and I heard him, he had been touched by the Spirit of the Lord, and in that hour through the pouring in of that spirit had flooded out the hostility that had filled his heart. He tearfully declared his determined intent to leave vengeance to the Lord and justice to the law. He would no longer hate the one who had caused the grievous loss. He would forgive and would not for another hour permit the corrosive spirit of vengefulness to fill his heart.\nSometime later, touched with the remembrance of that moving Sabbath morning, I told the story to a group of people in another city. Before I left that small community the next day I had a visit from a man who had heard the message and understood it. Later a letter came from him. He had gone home that night and prayed and prepared himself and had then made a visit to the place of a man in his community who had years before imposed upon the sanctity of his home. There had been animosity and revenge in his heart and threats made. That evening when it was made known that he was at the door, his frightened neighbor appeared with a weapon in his hand. The man quickly explained the reasons for his visit, that he had come to say that he was sorry, that he did not want hatred to continue to consume his life. He offered forgiveness and sought forgiveness and went his way in tears, a free man for the first time in years. He left a former adversary also in tears, shaken and repentant.\nThe next day the same man went to the home of a relative in the town. He said, “I came to ask your forgiveness. I don’t even remember why we have been so long angry, but I have come to tell you that I am sorry and to beg your pardon and to say that I have learned how foolish I have been.” He was invited in to join the family at their table, and was reunited with his kin.\nWhen I heard his story I knew again the importance of qualifying ourselves for the forgiveness of Christ by forgiving.\nRobert Louis Stevenson wrote: “The truth of Christ’s teaching seems to be this: In our own person and fortune, we should be ready to accept and pardon all; it is our cheek we are to turn and our coat we are to give to the man who has taken our cloak. But when another’s face is buffeted, perhaps a little of the lion will become us best. That we are to suffer others to be injured and stand by, is not conceivable and surely not desirable.”\nSo there are times when, in defense of others and principle, we must act. But of ourselves, if we suffer injury or unkindness, we must pray for the strength to forbear.\nChrist gave his life on a cross; and on that cross he fully, freely forgave. It is a worthy goal to seek to qualify for the friendship of such a one.\nMore than 250 years ago Joseph Addison printed in a paragraph of sobering thoughtfulness:\n“When I look upon the tombs of the great, every emotion of envy dies in me; when I read the epitaphs of the beautiful, every inordinate desire goes out; when I meet with the grief of parents upon a tombstone, my heart melts with compassion; when I see the tombs of the parents themselves, I consider the vanity of grieving for those whom we must quickly follow; when I see kings lying by those who deposed them, when I consider rival wits placed side by side, or the men that divided the world with their contests and disputes, I reflect with sorrow and astonishment on the little competitions, factions, and debates of mankind. When I read the several dates of the tombs, of some that died yesterday, and some six hundred years ago, I consider that great Day when we shall all of us be contemporaries, and make our appearance together.”\nGod help us to rid ourselves of resentment and pettiness and foolish pride; to love, and to forgive, in order that we may be friends with ourselves, with others, and with the Lord.\n“… even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.” (Col. 3:13.)\nIn the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "My beloved brothers and sisters and friends: Because of a great desire to be understood, I have humbly prayed for the Spirit of the Lord, and I also earnestly seek your sustaining spirit in what I have to say.\nRecently a father of a family of six children, who has had the sole responsibility for raising the family, beginning when the youngest was in diapers, told of the struggles in raising the family alone. One night he came home from work, faced with the problems of being both father and mother and felt unusually burdened with his responsibilities. One of his appreciative little girls, age 12 years, approached him eagerly, after having laid a rock on his dresser, which she had painted at school. On the flat portion of the rock she had written, “Happiness is having a dad who cares.” This painted rock and its sublime message instantly and permanently lightened the burden of this father.\nSome years ago, from this pulpit, President Stephen L Richards quoted Judge Samuel S. Liebowitz, to both of whom I give full acknowledgement, in an article appearing in the entitled “Nine Words That Can Stop Juvenile Delinquency.” The nine words suggested by the judge were, “Put father back at the head of the family.” President Richards concluded from the article “that the primary reasons for reduced percentages of juvenile delinquency in certain European countries, was a respect for authority in the home, which normally reposes in the father as head of the family.” President Richards continued: “For generations in the Church, we have been endeavoring to do just what the judge advocates, to put and keep the father at the head of the family, and with all our might, we have been trying to make him fit for that high and heavy responsibility.” Since the primary purpose of the Church is to help the family and its members, how well the father functions in his responsibility is of utmost importance.\nIn urging that the fathers be put back at the head of their homes, we wish to take nothing away from mothers. In all the world, there is no higher or greater honor or responsibility than motherhood. It is to be hoped that they too will have their powerful influence extended to even a greater degree within the home and beyond the home.\nIn order to strengthen the father in his position, I make two simple suggestions: first, sustain and respect the father in his position; second, give him love, understanding, and some appreciation for his efforts.\nThere are some voices in our society who would demean some of the attributes of masculinity. A few of these are women who mistakenly believe that they build their own feminine causes by tearing down the image of manhood. This has serious social overtones, because a primary problem in the insecurity of both sons and daughters can be the diminution of the role of the father image.\nLet every mother understand that if she does anything to diminish her children’s father or the father’s image in the eyes of the children, it may injure and do irreparable damage to the self-esteem and personal security of the children themselves. How infinitely more productive and satisfying it is for a woman to build up her husband rather than tear him down. You women are so superior to men in so many ways that you demean yourselves by posturing or belittling masculinity and manhood.\nIn terms of giving to fathers love and understanding, it should be remembered that fathers also have times of insecurity and doubt. Everyone knows fathers make mistakes—especially they themselves. Fathers are in need of all the help they can get; mostly they need love, support, and understanding from their own.\nPresident Harold B. Lee has said, “Most men do not set priorities to guide them in allocating their time and most men forget that the first priority should be to maintain their own spiritual and physical strength; then comes their family; then the Church and then their professions, and all need time.” ( sec. 2, p. 7.) In giving time to his children, a father should be able to demonstrate that he has enough love for his children to command as well as discipline them. Children want and need discipline. As they approach some dangers, they are silently pleading, “Don’t let me do it.” President [David O.] McKay said that if we do not adequately discipline our children, society will discipline them in a way we may not like. Wise discipline reinforces the dimensions of eternal love. This reinforcement will bring great security and stability into their lives.\nAll society, including the adult single members, for whom I have special concern, have a vested interest in fathers and mothers and families. Recently, Elder Boyd K. Packer said to the single members of the Church, “We talk a lot about families. Sometimes in bitterness, you will want to say ‘all this talk about families, but I don’t have a family, and … ,’ stop there! Don’t add that extra phrase, ‘I wish they would stop talking so much about families.’ You pray that we do keep talking about families; about fathers and mothers and children and family home evening, temple marriage and companionship and all of the rest, because all of that will be yours. If we stop talking about it, then you, among all others, will be the losers.” (Melchizedek Priesthood MIA Conference, June 1973.)\nIn this Church we have another fatherlike relationship with our bishops who are the spiritual fathers of the wards. Recently I set apart the chief of police of a large city to serve as bishop for the second time. One of the women who was in the room at the time commented afterwards that she found it a little strange for the chief of police to be a bishop. The next morning in a conference meeting, the bishop responded by saying that he found nothing incompatible as chief of police with being bishop. He said that as chief of police he needed all of the help and guidance he could get from his ecclesiastical office as a spiritual father. He further said that he recommended the same source of help for all police chiefs.\nThe exalted position of a father was well stated by General Douglas MacArthur who said, “By profession, I am a soldier and take pride in that fact, but I am prouder, infinitely prouder, to be a father. A soldier destroys in order to build. A father only builds, never destroys. The one has the potentiality of death; the other embodies creation and life. And while the hordes of death are mighty, the battalions of life are mightier still. It is my hope that my son, when I am gone, will remember me, not for the battle, but in the home repeating with him, our simple, daily prayer, ‘Our Father Who art in Heaven.’” (Emerson Roy West, Bookcraft, Inc., 1968.)\nIt is important to remember that in this Church, the husbands and fathers, and members of the family through them, enjoy a power and influence in their lives, far beyond the natural gifts of intellect and character of the father. I refer to the priesthood of God, which every worthy man and boy over 12 years of age enjoys.\nA prominent Church and business leader in this community was born without life. His father, exercising his priesthood, made a promise that if his firstborn could live, that he, the father, would do all in his power to provide the proper example and teachings for his son. After a few minutes his infant son began to breathe and is well and vigorous to this day.\nIt is through the power of the priesthood that marriage and the family unit can extend into and continue throughout all eternity. The conscientious women of this Church wish to have such a righteous influence in abundance in their homes.\nJust a few weeks ago, in a stake conference, one gracious mother joyously recounted a marvelous experience of being in one of the temples with her husband and with all of her children but one and being sealed together as husband and wife and family for time and all eternity. Her husband, newly involved in the priesthood, sat in the conference audience a few rows back. For a moment she seemed to forget all of the rest of us and spoke only to him. Over the pulpit, and through the loudspeaker, with over 1,000 people in tears watching and listening, she said, “John, the children and I don’t know how to tell you what you mean to us. Until you honored the priesthood, the greatest blessings of eternity would not open up for us. Now they have. We all love you very much and we thank you with all our hearts for what you have made possible for us.”\nYou may recall the story about a child being trapped in a hole in the ground, who could only be extricated by sending another smaller child into the tunnel. One little fellow was approached to see if he would be willing to go down and rescue the one who was lodged. The lad said, “I am scared to go in that hole, but I will go if my father will hold the rope.”\nElder Richard L. Evans gave the proper dimension for all fathers in this faith when he said, “First of all, fathers are for giving a name and a heritage to their children—clean and honorable. Fathers are for long, hard work. Mostly their own kind of work. For not being home so much as mothers; for seeming to be pretty busy; and for trying to give their children the things their fathers never had. Fathers are for talking with, for encouraging; for putting arms around; for understanding mistakes, but not condoning them; for disciplining when needed, then loving all the more; for being strong and forceful, and for being tender and gentle.” (Emerson Roy West,)\nIt is always appropriate in all family relationships to ask, “What would Jesus do?” Having turned to the scriptures for the answer to this question, President [Marion G.] Romney testifies, “There in the gospel as recorded by St. John, I found the clear and certain answer: Jesus would always do the will of his Father. ‘For I do always those things that please him.’” (John 8:29.)\nGod bless you children to have listening ears and understanding hearts.\nGod bless you mothers for the endless dimension of your love and for all of the help you give the fathers of your children.\nGod bless you fathers to be equal to your overwhelming responsibilities and to have a father’s special caring for each one under your protective arms. “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16.)\nThat this may be so, I pray, in the name of the Lord, Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "year": 1973,
        "content": "President Lee concluded our last conference in April with the statement that in his 32 years as a General Authority he had learned that the most inspired preaching is always accompanied by beautiful, inspired music. I am grateful this morning to be sustained by the beautiful renditions of the choir.\n“Music,” Addison said, “is the only sensual gratification in which mankind may indulge to excess without injury to their moral or religious feelings.”\nIf that were true in his day, it is not in ours. Music, once that innocent, now is often used for wicked purposes.\nIt has been obvious for centuries that lyrics of the worst kind can be set to music that is innocent of itself. Words which are bad can be set to music which is otherwise good, and lead men astray.\nRecently the First Presidency restated this counsel:\n“Through music, man’s ability to express himself extends beyond the limits of the spoken language in both subtlety and power. Music can be used to exalt and inspire or to carry messages of degradation and destruction. It is therefore important that as Latter-day Saints we at all times apply the principles of the gospel and seek the guidance of the Spirit in selecting the music with which we surround ourselves.” ( August, 1973.)\nIn our day music itself has been corrupted. Music can, by its tempo, by its beat, by its intensity, dull the spiritual sensitivity of men.\nStudies citing physiological effects from some of the extreme music of today neglect the most serious thing concerning it.\nOur youth have been brought up on a diet of music that is loud and fast, more intended to agitate than to pacify, more intended to excite than to calm. Even so, there is a breadth of it, some soft enough to be innocent and appealing to our youth, and that which is hard, and that is where the problem is.\nOne of the signs of apostasy in the Christian churches today is the willingness of their ministers to compromise and introduce into what had been, theretofore, the most sacred religious meetings the music of the drug and the hard rock culture. Such music has little virtue and it is repellent to the Spirit of God.\nThe pity of it is, their foolishness has not accomplished the ends they sought. Their young people are not drawn to them as they hoped and expected. Rather, young people are inventing so-called churches of their own, groping and seeking for something that they find missing in their lives.\nSome have been critical when our leaders have exercised restraint on the kind of music we will allow at Church activities.\n“Do you want to lose your youth?” they ask.\nI would remind all such that it is not the privilege of those called as leaders to slide the Church about as though it were on casters, hoping to put it into the path that men or youth will be safe within it.\nPresident J. Reuben Clark said:\n“We may not, under our duty, provide or tolerate an unwholesome amusement on the theory that if we do not provide it the youth will go elsewhere to get it. We could hardly set up a roulette table in the Church amusement hall for gambling purposes, with the excuse that if we do not provide it the youth would go to a gambling hall to gamble. We can never really hold our youth thus. Our task is to help the home to plant better standards in the minds of the youth.”\nAnd so we urge parents in the Church to show as much interest in the records and tapes their children purchase as they would the books and magazines they bring into the home. There are many parents who would not for one moment tolerate a pornographic magazine in their homes who unwittingly provide money for music, some of which in its influence can be quite as damaging.\nSomeone said recently that no music could be degrading, that music in and of itself is harmless and innocent.\nIf that be true, then there should be some explanation for circumstances where local leaders have provided a building—expansive, light, and inviting—and have assembled a party of young people dressed modestly, well-groomed, with manners to match. Then overamplified sounds of hard music are introduced and an influence pours into the room that is repellent to the Spirit of God.\nThe youth of the Church, by and large, have found a sensible and reasonable adjustment to the grooming and dress styles of our day. Our young men and women can dress with decency and modesty and yet not be unstylish or look all that different or odd.\nWe have said a good deal through our youth organizations and at our Church schools about dress and grooming standards and have been successful.\nBy comparison, we have not given sufficient counsel and attention, I think, to the music that our young people consume. And “consume” is a proper word. There is much of today’s music that they may well enjoy, if they avoid the hard kind.\nParents and Church leaders who counsel young people in this area soon learn that they must move very wisely.\nIf a little child picks up a sharp object, sometimes a foolish adult will grab for it, frightened for the safety of the child. Instinctively, the child will grip it more tightly and perhaps be injured. The wise parent will trade him for it—some equally appealing, but harmless object, given in exchange, so that he lets go willingly and without tears.\nKeep that in mind when you have a problem with young people and their music. To change it may take some time and require inspiration.\nIn the Church we have great confidence in our youth; and, particularly in the last year or two, we have moved to a pattern of programming where their desires and wishes are more dominant in our activities.\nThis places great responsibility on you, our young people. Pay careful attention to the music you program for your activities.\nIt is not that we lack confidence in you. However, the breach between the world and the extremes of its music and the Church is wider in our day than ever in generations past. And the middle of the road runs through an entirely different valley now than it did a few years ago.\nRemember, young leaders, He is your Lord, and it is your Church quite as much as it is ours.\nI would recommend that you go through your record albums and set aside those records that promote the so-called new morality, the drug, or the hard rock culture. Such music ought not to belong to young people concerned about spiritual development.\nWhy not go through your collection? Get rid of the worst of it. Keep just the best of it. Be selective in what you consume and what you produce. It becomes a part of you.\nIf you are blessed with musical talent, develop a wide range of good music.\nThere is so much wonderful, uplifting music available that we can experience to our advantage. Our people ought to be surrounded by good music of all kinds.\nParents ought to foster good music in the home and cultivate a desire to have their children learn the hymns of inspiration.\nThe time for music lessons seems to come along when there are so many other expenses for the family with little children. But we encourage parents to include musical training in the lives of their children.\nSomehow Andrew and Olive Kimball did, and Spencer learned to play. Somehow Samuel and Louisa Lee managed to do it, and Harold learned to play. And now, as the leaders of the Church assemble for our sacred meetings in the upper room of the temple, we always sing a hymn. At the organ is President Spencer W. Kimball or President Harold B. Lee.\nHow wonderful is the music instructor who will teach children and youth to play and will acquaint them with good music in their formative years, including the music of worship. To have such music as a part of one’s life is a great blessing.\nThe Lord has said, “For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads.” (D&C 25:12.)\nI think I would like to share with the young people something about how such music has been very important in my life, although I am not trained as a musician.\nProbably the greatest challenge to people of any age, particularly young people, and the most difficult thing you will face in mortal life is to learn to control your thoughts. As a man “thinketh in his heart, so is he.” (Prov. 23:7.) One who can control his thoughts has conquered himself.\nWhen I was about ten years old, we lived in a home surrounded by an orchard. There never seemed to be enough water for the trees. The ditches, always fresh-plowed in the spring, would soon be filled with weeds. One day, in charge of the irrigating turn, I found myself in trouble.\nAs the water moved down the rows choked with weeds, it would flood in every direction. I raced through the puddles trying to build up the bank. As soon as I had one break patched up, there would be another.\nA neighbor came through the orchard. He watched for a moment, and then with a few vigorous strokes of the shovel he cleared the ditch bottom and allowed the water to course through the channel he had made.\n“If you want the water to stay in its course, you’ll have to make a place for it to go,” he said.\nI have come to know that thoughts, like water, will stay on course if we make a place for them to go. Otherwise our thoughts follow the course of least resistance, always seeking the lower levels.\nI had been told a hundred times or more as I grew up that thoughts must be controlled. But no one told me how.\nI want to tell you young people about one way you can learn to control your thoughts, and it has to do with music.\nThe mind is like a stage. Except when we are asleep the curtain is always up. There is always some act being performed on that stage. It may be a comedy, a tragedy, interesting or dull, good or bad; but always there is some act playing on the stage of the mind.\nHave you noticed that without any real intent on your part, in the middle of almost any performance, a shady little thought may creep in from the wings and attract your attention? These delinquent thoughts will try to upstage everybody.\nIf you permit them to go on, all thoughts of any virtue will leave the stage. You will be left, because you consented to it, to the influence of unrighteous thoughts.\nIf you yield to them, they will enact for you on the stage of your mind anything to the limits of your toleration. They may enact a theme of bitterness, jealousy, or hatred. It may be vulgar, immoral, even depraved.\nWhen they have the stage, if you let them, they will devise the most clever persuasions to hold your attention. They can make it interesting all right, even convince you that it is innocent—for they are but thoughts.\nWhat do you do at a time like that, when the stage of your mind is commandeered by the imps of unclean thinking?—whether they be the gray ones that seem almost clean or the filthy ones which leave no room for doubt.\nIf you can control your thoughts, you can overcome habits, even degrading personal habits. If you can learn to master them you will have a happy life.\nThis is what I would teach you. Choose from among the sacred music of the Church a favorite hymn, one with words that are uplifting and music that is reverent, one that makes you feel something akin to inspiration. Remember President Lee’s counsel; perhaps “I Am a Child of God” would do. Go over it in your mind carefully. Memorize it. Even though you have had no musical training, you can think through a hymn.\nNow, use this hymn as the place for your thoughts to go. Make it your emergency channel. Whenever you find these shady actors have slipped from the sidelines of your thinking onto the stage of your mind, put on this record, as it were.\nAs the music begins and as the words form in your thoughts, the unworthy ones will slip shamefully away. It will change the whole mood on the stage of your mind. Because it is uplifting and clean, the baser thoughts will disappear. For while virtue, by choice, will not associate with filth, evil cannot tolerate the presence of light.\nIn due time you will find yourself, on occasion, humming the music inwardly. As you retrace your thoughts, you discover some influence from the world about you encouraged an unworthy thought to move on stage in your mind, and the music almost automatically began.\n“Music,” said Gladstone, “is one of the most forceful instruments for governing the mind and spirit of man.”\nI am so grateful for music that is worthy and uplifting and inspiring.\nOnce you learn to clear the stage of your mind from unworthy thoughts, keep it busy with learning worthwhile things. Change your environment so that you have things about you that will inspire good and uplifting thoughts. Keep busy with things that are righteous.\nYoung people, you cannot afford to fill your mind with the unworthy hard music of our day. It is not harmless. It can welcome onto the stage of your mind unworthy thoughts and set the tempo to which they dance and to which you may act.\nYou degrade yourself when you identify with all of those things which seem now to surround such extremes in music: the shabbiness, the irreverence, the immorality, and the addictions. Such music as that is not worthy of you. You should have self-respect.\nYou are a son or a daughter of Almighty God. He has inspired a world full of wonderful things to learn and to do, uplifting music of many kinds that you may enjoy.\nThe choir, I think, will sing in conclusion, that pioneer hymn, “Come, Come, Ye Saints.”\nI have a brother who became a brigadier general in the Air Force. During World War II he was a bomber pilot and took part in some of the most dangerous and desperate raids in Europe. He returned to an assignment in Washington, D.C., about the time I finished pilot training in the same B-24 bombers and was heading for the Pacific. We had a day or two together in Washington before I left for overseas.\nWe talked of courage and of fear. I asked how he had held himself together in the face of all that he had endured.\nHe said, “I have a favorite hymn—‘Come, Come, Ye Saints,’ and when it was desperate, when there was little hope that we would return, I would keep that on my mind and it was as though the engines of the aircraft would sing back to me:\n\n‘Come, come, ye saints,\nNo toil nor labor fear;\nBut with joy wend your way.\nThough hard to you\nThis journey may appear,\nGrace shall be as your day.’”\n\n— no. 13\n\nFrom this he clung to faith, the one essential ingredient to courage.\nThere are many references in the scriptures, both ancient and modern, that attest to the influence of righteous music. The Lord, Himself, was prepared for His greatest test through its influence, for the scripture records: “And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.” (Mark 14:26.)\nI bear witness that God is our Father, that we are His children, that He loves us and has provided great and glorious things in this life. I know this, and I thank Him for the uplifting influence of good music in my life and in the lives of my children. There are many things we can do together as a family; inspired music we can feel together. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "One summer day I stood alone in the quiet of the American War Memorial Cemetery of the Philippines. A spirit of reverence filled the warm tropical air. Situated among the carefully mowed grass, acre upon acre, were markers identifying men, mostly young, who in battle gave their lives. As I let my eyes pass name by name along the many colonnades of honor, tears came easily and without embarrassment. As my eyes filled with tears, my heart swelled with pride. I contemplated the high price of liberty and the costly sacrifice many had been called upon to bear.\nMy thoughts turned from those who bravely served and gallantly died. There came to mind the grief-stricken mother of each fallen man as she held in her hand the news of her precious son’s supreme sacrifice. Who can measure a mother’s grief? Who can probe a mother’s love? Who can comprehend in its entirety the lofty role of a mother? With perfect trust in God, she walks, her hand in his, into the valley of the shadow of death that you and I might come forth unto life.\n\n“The Name of Mother”\n\n“The noblest thoughts my soul can claim,\nThe holiest words my tongue can frame,\nUnworthy are to frame the name\nMore sacred than all other.\nAn infant when her love first came,\nA man, I find it just the same:\nReverently I breathe her name—\nThe blessed name of mother.”\n\n—George Griffith Fetter\n\nIn this spirit, let us consider mother. Four mothers come to mind: first, mother forgotten; second, mother remembered; third, mother blessed; and finally, mother loved.\n“Mother forgotten” is observed all too frequently. The nursing homes are crowded, the hospital beds are full, the days come and go—often the weeks and months pass—but mother is not visited. Can we not appreciate the pangs of loneliness, the yearnings of mother’s heart when hour after hour, alone in her age, she gazes out the window for the loved one who does not visit, the letter the postman does not bring. She listens for the knock that does not sound, the telephone that does not ring, the voice she does not hear. How does such a mother feel when her neighbor welcomes gladly the smile of a son, the hug of a daughter, the glad exclamation of a child, “Hello, Grandmother.”\nThere are yet other ways we forget mother. Whenever we fall, whenever we do less than we ought, in a very real way we forget mother.\nLast Christmas I talked to the proprietress of a Salt Lake City nursing home. From the hallway where we stood, she pointed to several elderly women assembled in a peaceful living room. She observed, “There’s Mrs. Hansen. Her daughter visits her every week, right at 3:00 p.m. on Sunday. To her right is Mrs. Peek. Each Wednesday there is a letter in her hands from her son in New York. It is read, then reread, then saved as a precious piece of treasure. But see Mrs. Carroll; her family never telephones, never writes, never visits. Patiently she justifies this neglect with words which are heard but do not convince or excuse, ‘They are all so busy.’” Shame on all who thus make of a noble woman “mother forgotten.”\n“Hearken unto thy father that begat thee,” wrote Solomon, “and despise not thy mother when she is old.” (Prov. 23:22.) Can we not make of a mother forgotten a “mother remembered”?\nMen turn from evil and yield to their better natures when mother is remembered. A famed officer from the Civil War period, Colonel Higgenson, when asked to name the incident of the Civil War that he considered the most remarkable for bravery, said that there was in his regiment a man whom everybody liked, a man who was brave and noble, who was pure in his daily life, absolutely free from dissipations in which most of the other men indulged.\nOne night at a champagne supper, when many were becoming intoxicated, someone in jest called for a toast from this young man. Colonel Higgenson said that he arose, pale but with perfect self-control, and declared: “Gentlemen, I will give you a toast which you may drink as you will, but which I will drink in water. The toast that I have to give is, ‘Our mothers.’”\nInstantly a strange spell seemed to come over all the tipsy men. They drank the toast in silence. There was no laughter, no more song, and one by one they left the room. The lamp of memory had begun to burn, and the name of “Mother” touched every man’s heart.\nAs a boy, I well remember Sunday School on Mother’s Day. We would hand to each mother present a small potted plant and sit in silent reverie as Melvin Watson, a blind member, would stand by the piano and sing, “That Wonderful Mother of Mine.” This was the first time I saw a blind man cry. Even today, in memory, I can see the moist tears move from those sightless eyes, then form tiny rivulets and course down his cheeks, falling finally upon the lapel of the suit he had never seen. In boyhood puzzlement I wondered why all of the grown men were silent, why so many handkerchiefs came forth. Now I know. You see, mother was remembered. Each boy, every girl, all fathers and husbands seemed to make a silent pledge: “I will remember that wonderful mother of mine.”\n\nSome years ago I listened intently as a man well beyond middle age told me of an experience in his family history. The widowed mother who had given birth to him and his brothers and sisters had gone to her eternal and well-earned reward. The family assembled at the home and surrounded the large dining room table. The small metal box in which Mother had kept her earthly treasures was opened reverently. One by one each keepsake was brought forth. There was the wedding certificate from the Salt Lake Temple. “Oh, now Mother could be with Dad.” Then there was the deed to the humble home where each child had in turn entered upon the stage of life. The appraised value of the house had little resemblance to the worth Mother had attached to it.\nThen there was discovered a yellowed envelope which bore the marks of time. Carefully the flap was opened and from inside was taken a homemade valentine. Its simple message, in the handwriting of a child, read, “I love you, Mother.” Though she was gone, by what she held sacred, Mother taught yet another lesson. A silence permeated the room, and every member of the family made a pledge not only to remember, but also to honor mother. For them it was not too little and too late, as in the classic poem of Rose Marinoni entitled “At Sunrise”:\n\n“They pushed him straight against the wall,\nThe firing squad dropped in a row;\nAnd why he stood on tiptoe,\nThose men shall never know.\nHe wore a smile across his face\nAs he stood primly there,\nThe guns straight aiming at his heart,\nThe sun upon his hair.\nFor he remembered in a flash\nThose days beyond recall,\nWhen his proud mother took his height\nAgainst the bedroom wall.”\n\nNow that we have considered “mother remembered,” let us turn to “mother blessed.” For one of the most beautiful and reverent examples, I refer to the holy scriptures.\nIn the New Testament of our Lord, perhaps we have no more moving account of “mother blessed” than the tender regard of the Master for the grieving widow at Nain.\n“And it came to pass … that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.\n“Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.\n“And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.\n“And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.\n“And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.” (Luke 7:11–15.)\nWhat power, what tenderness, what compassion did our Master and exemplar thus demonstrate. We, too, can bless if we will but follow his noble example. Opportunities are everywhere. Needed are eyes to see the pitiable plight, ears to hear the silent pleadings of a broken heart. Yes, and a soul filled with compassion that we might communicate not only eye to eye or voice to ear, but in the majestic style of the Savior, even heart to heart. Then every mother everywhere will be “mother blessed.”\nFinally, let us contemplate “mother loved.” Universally applicable is the poem recalled from childhood and enjoyed by children even today, “Which Loved Best?”\n\n“‘I love you, Mother,’ said little John;\nThen, forgetting his work, his cap went on,\nAnd he was off to the garden swing,\nLeaving his mother the wood to bring.\n\n“‘I love you, Mother,’ said rosy Nell;\n‘I love you better than tongue can tell’;\nThen she teased and pouted full half the day,\nTill her mother rejoiced when she went to play.\n\n“‘I love you, Mother,’ said little Fan;\n‘Today I’ll help you all I can;\nHow glad I am that school doesn’t keep!’\nSo she rocked the baby till it fell asleep.\n\n“Then, stepping softly, she took the broom,\nAnd swept the floor, and dusted the room;\nBusy and happy all day was she,\nHelpful and cheerful as child could be.\n\n“‘I love you, Mother,’ again they said—\nThree little children going to bed;\nHow do you think that Mother guessed\nWhich of them really loved her best?”\n\n—Joy Allison\n\nOne certain way each can demonstrate genuine love for mother is to live the truths mother so patiently taught. Such a lofty goal is not new to our present generation. On this continent, in times described in the Book of Mormon, we read of a brave, a good, and noble leader named Helaman who did march in righteous battle at the head of 2,000 young men. Helaman described the activities of these young men: “… never had I seen so great courage, … as … they said unto me: … behold our God is with us, and he will not suffer that we should fall; then let us go forth; … Now they never had fought, yet they did not fear death; … yea, they had been taught by their mothers, that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them. And they rehearsed unto me the words of their mothers, saying: We do not doubt our mothers knew it.” (Alma 56:45–48.)\nAt the end of the battle, Helaman continued his description: “… behold, to my great joy, there had not one soul of them fallen to the earth; yea, and they had fought as if with the strength of God; yea, never were men known to have fought with such miraculous strength; and with such mighty power. …” (Alma 56:56.)\nMiraculous strength, mighty power—mother’s love and love for mother had met and triumphed.\nThe holy scriptures, the pages of history are replete with tender, moving, convincing accounts of “mother loved.” One, however, stands out supreme, above and beyond any other. The place is Jerusalem, the period known as the Meridian of Time. Assembled is a throng of Roman soldiers. Their helmets signify their loyalty to Caesar, their shields bear his emblem, their spears are crowned by Roman eagles. Assembled also are natives to the land of Jerusalem. Faded into the still night, and gone forever are the militant and rowdy cries, “Crucify him, crucify him.”\nThe hour has come. The personal earthly ministry of the Son of God moves swiftly to its dramatic conclusion. A certain loneliness is here. Nowhere to be found are the lame beggars who, because of this man, walk; the deaf who, because of this man, hear; the blind who, because of this man, see; the dead who, because of this man, live.\nThere remained yet a few faithful followers. From his tortured position on the cruel cross, he sees his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing by. He speaks: “… woman, behold thy son! Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! …” (John 19:26–27.)\nFrom that awful night when time stood still, when the earth did quake and great mountains were brought down—yes, through the annals of history, over the centuries of years and beyond the span of time, there echoes his simple yet divine words, “Behold thy mother!”\nAs we truly listen to that gentle command and with gladness obey its intent, gone forever will be the vast legions of “mothers forgotten.” Everywhere present will be “mothers remembered,” “mothers blessed,” and “mothers loved” and, as in the beginning, God will once again survey the workmanship of his own hand and be led to say, “It [is] very good.”\nMay each of us treasure this truth; one cannot forget mother and remember God. One cannot remember mother and forget God. Why? Because these two sacred persons, God and mother, partners in creation, in love, in sacrifice, in service, are as one.\nMay we, by our thoughts and our actions, honor God and mother, I pray humbly yet earnestly, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "It is a great blessing to be here today. After briefing the office staff at our mission in Virginia, I turned to leave, and our treasurer and fleet coordinator said: “President, just tell President Lee we’re behind him.” On behalf of all the missionaries throughout the world who testify daily that Jesus is the Christ and of your prophetic calling, President Lee, we want you to know, “We are behind you.”\nWilliam Jennings Bryan wrote:\n\n“The human measure of a human life is its income;\nthe divine measure of a life is its outgo, its overflow—\nits contribution to the welfare of all.”\n\n(From by William Jennings Bryan.)\n\nIn our search for happiness we may get so involved with the “human measure of life” that we fail to recognize the temporary value of such riches. Christ warned that we can become spiritually “choked” with the “cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.” (Luke 8:14.)\nThe Savior also said, “… a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.\n“And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:\n“And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?\n“And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.\n“And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou has much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.\n“But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?\n“So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.” (Luke 12:15–21.)\nIt is, then, our blessing and responsibility to become rich toward God. We are to go beyond acquiring something for ourselves. The Savior also taught us how to do this when he said, “… seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you” (Luke 12:31), and, “… whoso desireth to reap, let him thrust in his sickle with his might, and reap while the day lasts, that he may treasure up for his soul everlasting salvation in the kingdom of God.” (D&C 6:3.)\nThis means we may gain eternal life. “Behold, he that hath eternal life is rich.” (D&C 11:7.)\nThe significance of this truth was brought to the heart of a certain man when his friend approached him with a plan to obtain the riches of this life. He wrote:\n“Dear friend,\n“During one of our conversations you said something which has been on my mind ever since. In fact, you might say that it has really ‘troubled’ me and has caused me to do some real ‘soul’ searching. In explaining why you felt compelled to make the sales plan known to me, you said, ‘I would feel real bad a few years from now if I knew about this, got rich from it, and did not tell my friends about it.’\n“You will never know how that statement has troubled me because I have made no attempt to share something more precious than money with you. I am speaking of the true gospel of Jesus Christ.\n“Now hold on a minute. I know what is going through your mind. ‘This kook has lost his cool and gone off the deep end.’ T’ain’t so. I believe we spent enough time together in the past couple of years for you to know that I haven’t turned into a freak or something. But I am sure you have noticed a change. I no longer do many of the earthly things you probably remember of me. I have a great love for my family and mankind in general. I am truly sorry for many things in my past and will do my best to never do them again. But this isn’t the most important thing.\n“The most important thing in all this world is that I know that I existed in the preexistence as a spirit child of my Heavenly Father; that I am here in mortality as part of his great plan for me in order that I may prove my worthiness to him by constantly making the proper choices between good and evil; and that if I prove myself worthy I will return to his presence.\n“I further know that there is a prophet, Harold B. Lee, here upon the earth today who communicates regularly with the true and living Jesus Christ, the son of God. Through this prophet I can learn everything necessary to help me live my life and guide my family in the proper manner to return to his presence.\n“Oh, there is so much more that I could tell you, but suffice it to say that there is absolutely no unanswered question in my mind concerning my reason for being here at this time, nor what reward I will earn if I obey the teachings of my Father in heaven.\n“Of course, I have learned all of these things through study and prayer and the teachings of the Mormon Church (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints). It is this that I have never shared with you that has troubled my conscience so.\n“Now I am going to do something about it. At the same time this letter is mailed, I am sending your name to the Church representatives in your area and asking them to contact you. They will undoubtedly send a couple of young men (or lady) missionaries to see you. These will be people who are dedicating a couple of years of their lives at their or their family’s expense to tell people like yourselves of this gospel. They have about six one-hour lessons they will want to teach you. I beg of you to listen to their message. I testify to you that it is true.”\nI also testify that this is the true Church, that Harold B. Lee is a prophet of the true and living God, and that this gospel of Jesus Christ is more precious than money.\nA recent Relief Society film, “Walk in the Light,” highlights the incident of a young granddaughter who desired to become the heir to her grandmother’s watch. It seemed to the grandchild a real treasure. Here are the soul-stirring words of her grandmother’s reply:\n“The watch is of small value. But I do want to leave you something very precious. It is something I brought with me all the way from Scotland. I carried it with me across the plains. It is something that will be of value to you all the days of your life and into the eternities. I want to leave to you my testimony—my testimony of the gospel. I know that the gospel is true. I know that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ.”\nIt is said that many grandchildren honor the name of that grandmother and recall her testimony with joy. How great are the riches she has laid up in store in our Heavenly Father’s kingdom.\nI am grateful to the Lord for you members of the Church who desire to share the wealth of the gospel of Jesus Christ with your family and friends. Not only are you becoming rich toward God, but you are making other lives rich also. You are giving them the true Christian religion.\nPatrick Henry, a great American patriot, said:\n“I have now disposed of all my property to my family. There is one thing more I wish I could give them, and that is the Christian religion. If they had that, and I had not given them one shilling they would have been rich, and if they had not that, and I had given them all the world, they would be poor.”\nMay we all share our wealth of testimony with others that we and they may become rich toward God, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "So many timely subjects have been discussed today, beginning with the great address by President Lee, that I have been edified and I am sure that you have been as well. Now I humbly pray that I may not detract from but may add a little bit to your thinking and doing as we consider the second great principle of the gospel. I feel there is need for it.\nThe primary purpose of the gospel and of the Church is to provide a pattern for living and a prescription for happiness and success—here and hereafter. President McKay declared on many occasions that next in importance to life itself is the privilege of directing that life. To direct one’s life is a privilege. It is also a real personal responsibility.\nSpeaking to his sons, Lehi explained this by saying: “Wherefore, men are free. … They are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great mediation of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.\n“And now, my sons, I would that ye should look to the great Mediator, and hearken unto his great commandments; and be faithful unto his words, and choose eternal life, according to the will of his Holy Spirit;\n“And not choose eternal death, according to the will of the flesh and the evil which is therein, which giveth the spirit of the devil power to captivate, to bring you down to hell, that he may reign over you in his own kingdom.” (2 Ne. 2:27–29.)\nBecause sin is such a devastating, destructive force, the great principle of repentance was provided by our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, to extricate ourselves from the clutches of sin. Without the blessed privilege of repentance, we would have but little incentive to improve our lives.\nRepentance isn’t easy. It takes ability. It takes self-discipline and humility.\nRepentance is not a negative teaching, but rather it is a positive process of building good character.\nRepentance could become a remedy for most spiritual ills. However, it is not a mere superficial, shallow-rooted expression of regret.\nWhat, then, is true repentance?\nPresident Joseph F. Smith declared that: “True repentance is not only sorrow for sins, and humble penitence and contrition before God, but it involves the necessity of turning away from them [sins], a discontinuance of all evil practices and deeds, a thorough reformation of life, a vital change from evil to good, from vice to virtue, from darkness to light. Not only so, but to make restitution, so far as it is possible, for all the wrongs we have done, to pay our debts, and restore to God and man their rights—that which is due to them from us. This is true repentance, and the exercise of the will and all the powers of body and mind is demanded, to complete this glorious work of repentance; [only] then God will accept it.” ( p. 123.)\nIf one truly repents, it will be manifested by his works, for, “By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins—behold, he will confess them and forsake them.” (D&C 58:43.)\nThus repentance calls for a heartfelt sorrow for sin resulting not only in a cessation thereof but also in reformation of life. That’s the important thing—a reformation of life!\nTo repent isn’t exactly popular these days. Yet the Lord expects each of us to repent, to improve, and to conscientiously reform our lives. In fact, he set for us a lofty goal, saying:\n“Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.” (Matt. 5:48.)\nAdmittedly, this is an imperfect world. Nevertheless, each of us should be constantly striving toward perfection.\n\n“Let him that stole steal no more. …” (Eph. 4:28.)\n\n“… let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly. …” (D&C 121:45.)\n\n“… pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.” (Matt. 5:44.) Destroy your enemies by making them your friends.\n\nLet the unkind among us become considerate.\n\nLet the truth be spoken always, no matter what the consequences may be.\n\nI would like to add Brother Packer’s recommendation that we rid ourselves of the unmusical music and adopt some that does the soul and the heart good and which is pleasing to the Lord. We can at least do that in our own homes.\nTo practice such virtues as these gives evidence of forsaking wrong. We ought not to let personal faults, bad habits, and moral weaknesses persist. They should be overcome and corrected without delay. I have often said: “You can’t repent too soon because you don’t know how soon it will be too late.”\nOne of my distant Scandinavian relatives who was thriving financially in Denmark came with his family as converts to the Church to America and his family was directed to settle in Sanpete County. He was quite well-to-do, as I said, and he sold his lands, herds, and flocks for what he could and came without complaint. For a while he did well as far as the Church and his activities were concerned; and amazingly, even without the abundant rainfall and the water and the resources, he began to thrive again. He accumulated wealth again. He became so interested and involved in his possessions that he forgot about the purpose of his coming to America. They waited upon him as ward teachers. The bishop would call upon him and implore him to become active as he used to be, and he would promise them that in the future when he got certain things settled that he would do it. Finally he was growing old, and they came and said to him, “Now, Lars, the Lord was good to you when you were in Denmark. He has been good to you since you have come here. See all of the things that you possess. We think now, since you are growing a little older, that it would be well for you to spend some of your time in the interests of the Church. After all, you can’t take these things with you when you go.”\nHe stopped. He was shocked, and he said, “Vell, den, I vill not go.” But he did. And so will we. It is time today to begin the program and process of repenting!\nBrothers and sisters, you know and I know that the power of the destroyer is persistently, relentlessly operating upon the minds and hearts of the children of men, young and old, in the Church and out of the Church, and too many are yielding to his evil enticements.\nWe have been warned by the Lord and by our leaders through the years to repent. President Lee this morning urged us to begin with ourselves and develop self-respect, and beginning there, set out on the real purpose of life.\nWe have been supplied with heaven-sent programs such as the family home evening program, to keep families secure and our homes intact. It has been predicted that in the last days men shall become “lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.” (2 Tim. 3:4.)\n“For behold, at that day shall he rage in the hearts of the children of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good.\n“And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well—and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell.” (2 Ne. 28:20–21.)\nI like that word carefully because that is the way he operates. He never jerks. He never pulls—just misleads us gradually, step by step. Now in this situation and in the world today, let us remember the admonition of James:\n“Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.\n“Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.\n“Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.” (James 4:7–8, 10.)\nMay we all repent and place our lives and our homes in order and in perfect harmony with the gospel of Jesus Christ, I pray, testifying to the truthfulness of the restored gospel and in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

So Eve was created and given to Adam to be his wife and companion.\nMany of you young people in the Church have reached an age where you are old enough to look for a companion and mate. As you commence dating on a steady basis, you will enter a period known as courtship. This will be a thrilling and important time in your lives. President McKay referred to it in these words:\n“Courtship is a wonderful period. It should be a sacred one. That is the time in which you choose your mate. Young men, your success in life depends upon that choice. Choose prayerfully the one who inspires you to your best and always remember that no man injures the thing he loves. … The seeds of a happy marriage are sown in youth. Happiness does not begin at the altar; it begins during the period of youth and courtship. …”\nYoung people, choose prayerfully and carefully. Don’t rush hastily into marriage. Determine that you have common goals and interests. Especially be certain that you possess the same religious convictions and beliefs.\nA wise man once counseled: “Before marriage keep thine eyes wide open, then after marriage keep them half closed.”\nMarriage brings adjustments, because each has his or her own personality. Reared in homes with varying backgrounds, marriage naturally will require the making of adjustments.\nMarriage, my beloved young brothers and sisters, should not be just taken for granted. It must be worked at, but realize that you can have the kind of marriage that you earnestly desire and for which you are willing to work. Marriage will require giving and taking; it will mean sharing, because life was meant to be shared. A happy and successful marriage means forgetting oneself and thinking of ways in which to make one’s companion happy. It might be well each day for the husband to think, “What can I do today to make Mary happy?” And Mary should say to herself, “What can I do today to make John happy?” A happy home is where the wife is treated like a queen and the husband is treated like a king. And so, it is not only marrying the right partner, it is being the right partner.\nA happy and successful marriage will be one that is built on the important principle of love; a love recognizing not only a fleeting physical attraction, but more importantly a deeply spiritual love that will continue forever. At the dedication of the beautiful Oakland Temple, the prophet of the Lord, David O. McKay, emphasized the fact that love is eternal in these words: “One great purpose carried out by those who come into the temple is the sealing of man and wife in the sacred bonds of matrimony. That purpose is based upon the fact that man and woman truly love each other. That means that a couple coming to the altar should be sure that there is love in each heart. It would be a terrible thing to be bound for eternity to one whom you do not love, but it is a glorious thing to be sealed for time and eternity to one whom you do love.” President McKay then continued, saying: “Let us ever remember that love is the divinest attribute of the human soul. … love must be fed; … Love must be nourished; love can be starved to death just as literally as the body can be starved without daily sustenance. … If that love is fed daily and monthly and yearly throughout a lifetime, the husband’s attention will not be drawn to somebody else. …” He then concluded with these words: “If your spirit lives after death, as it does, then that attribute of love will persist. …” (David O. McKay, “Responsibilities of Those Who Enter the Temple,” vol. 68 [1965], p. 92.)\nHoneymoons should not end right after the marriage ceremony, but should never cease. President and Sister McKay set a wonderful example to the Church and to the world. On their 65th wedding anniversary President McKay referred to their married life as 65 years of “wedded courtship.”\nThere are many kinds of marriages, but Latter-day Saints should realize that there is only one place on earth where one can obtain a first-class marriage, and that is in a House of the Lord, and it is one of the purposes for which temples are built. What a worthwhile and splendid tradition it is for those who are married and sealed in the temple to return each year on or near their wedding anniversary and recall the promises they have made to each other and to the Lord. Of course, this will be in addition to the many other times that they will attend the temple.\nWe are mindful that the Church has constantly stressed the importance of the home. Many valuable and worthwhile suggestions and programs have been introduced to point to ways in which a happy home may be realized.\nI am convinced that a happy home is the result of a happy marriage: that is why it is so important to select a suitable companion and mate.\nIn our world today there is an apparent disregard for the marriage vows made, and we view with concern and alarm the noticeable increase in divorces throughout the land. This would indicate that homes are not happy and, as a result, marriages are failing. Too many men and women become discontented and develop a “roving eye” as their attention is attracted to someone else. Hence, too many divorces are a result of unfaithfulness on the part of the wife, the husband, or both. There would be fewer divorces if the counsel and guidance given by the Lord were followed. In a revelation to the Prophet Joseph he said: “Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else.” (D&C 42:22.)\nI am persuaded that many divorces today could be avoided and are not justifiable. President Stephen L Richards, a former counselor in the First Presidency, once aptly remarked: “In the case of marital disagreement, which may lead to separation, the proper remedy is not divorce, but repentance—repentance usually on the part of both husband and wife, repentance for both acts committed and harsh words which have made a ‘hell’ instead of a ‘heaven’ out of the home.”\nIn order for a married couple to make a “heaven” out of their home, they must realize that repentance, love, faithfulness, humility, and forgiveness are basic essentials in achieving this noble and lofty goal.\nA serene home must also be a place where the Spirit of the Lord will dwell and abide. The Spirit of the Lord will not dwell nor abide in a home where there is constant bickering, quarreling, arguing, discord, or disharmony.\nThe Prophet Joseph had to learn many of these valuable lessons, as we will likewise have to do. David Whitmer, a close associate of the Prophet and one of the Three Witnesses for the Book of Mormon, related an enlightening experience which occurred while the prophet was translating the gold plates. These are Brother Whitmer’s words:\n“He [Joseph] was a religious and straightforward man. He had to be; for he was illiterate and could do nothing himself. He had to trust in God. He could not translate unless he was humble and possessed the right feelings towards everyone. To illustrate so you can see: One morning when he was getting ready to continue the translation, something went wrong about the house and he was put out about it. Something that Emma, his wife, had done. Oliver and I went upstairs and Joseph came up soon after to continue the translation but he could not do anything. He could not translate a single syllable. He went downstairs, out into the orchard, and made supplication to the Lord; was gone about an hour—came back to the house, and asked Emma’s forgiveness and then came upstairs where we were and then the translation went on all right. He could do nothing save he was humble and faithful.” (Brigham H. Roberts, vol. 1, p. 131.)\nIt is my sincere and humble prayer that we may all live in such a way that we will have happy and serene homes where love abounds and the Spirit of the Lord is ever present, for which I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. Amen."

        "content": "It is an inspiration to all of us to remember the teachings of our Savior and the many wonderful things that he gave to the world. He lived long before recorded history. He was in the great council in heaven—he helped his Father in the shaping of the heavens, in the creation of the earth, and in the making of man.\nIn opposition to Satan’s plan, it was he who proposed man’s free agency—giving him the glorious privilege of choice which means so much to all of us.\nHe lived on earth in the meridian of time—in the promised land.\nHe went about teaching and doing good. Men followed him, not for worldly riches but to gain treasures in heaven.\nHe set up a new code for living—to love one another—even one’s enemies. He enjoined us to judge not, to forgive, and to give all men a second chance.\nIn the Doctrine and Covenants section 64, verses 8–11, he tells us that it is our duty to forgive one another and that he who does not forgive his brother stands condemned and is the greater sinner.\nHe gave our society our most undying formula for getting along together when he made this statement found in Matthew 7:12:\n“Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.”\nThere are very few of us that are fully living up to this. Yet I am sure we all agree that if men followed this principle they would solve the problems that we are now facing in all the nations of the earth. Yes, if we lived this principle it would be easy to love and forgive those who trespass against us.\nIn Matthew 22:36–39, we read about an instance where Christ was approached by some of the leading lawyers of the day who said:\n“Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.”\nIt should be remembered that our nearest neighbors are the members of our own family. Next are those living next door to us, in the same block, the same city, the same state, the nation, yes, even the whole world. All whom we associate with or influence in any way are our neighbors.\nCan a man reach the celestial kingdom if he does not love his neighbor as himself? When Jesus gave the second commandment, He said it was like unto the first and repeating both of them he said, “On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.” (Matt. 22:40.)\nHe made them very important—so important that all other laws and commandments rest upon them.\nLet us ask another question. Can a man live the first and great commandment if he does not live the second? In other words, can he love God with all his heart if he does not love his neighbor?\nJohn the apostle said:\n“If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.” (1 Jn. 4:20–21.)\nIn third Nephi 11:29–30 we find this statement:\n“For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.\n“Behold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men with anger, one against another; but this is my doctrine, that such things should be done away.”\nThese statements and many others should make it clear to all of us that the Lord desires us to love and forgive one another. It behooves us to conquer our pride and settle our differences with our fellowmen. As just quoted from third Nephi, contentions and disputations are of the devil and are not approved by our Heavenly Father. Loving our neighbors as ourselves will bring great joy and happiness into our lives.\nChrist practiced forgiveness. You remember the story of the woman that had sinned. The law was that she should be stoned to death. They brought her before the Savior to see how he would judge her. In John 8:6–7 it is recorded:\n“This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.\n“So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.”\nNot any in the group could qualify, and the crowd dispersed. He then turned to the woman and said: “Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.” (John 8:11.) He certainly did not approve of what she had done, but he demonstrated forgiveness and left it up to his Father in heaven to judge her.\nHe forgave those who would take his life. At the very time when he was suffering the most, he said: “Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.” (Luke 23:34.)\nThe gospel he brought to earth and which was restored in this dispensation provides us with a beautiful plan of salvation. We know that we had a previous existence and were valiant there. The Lord permitted us to come to earth that we might obtain a body, gain knowledge, develop our skills and our characters, learn to overcome evil, and see if we can remain true and faithful to him, and be sufficiently diligent and obedient to the commandments as to be worthy to return and abide in his presence.\nMany of our problems are blessings in disguise. They are provided so that we might gain the experiences intended for us on this earth and thus prepare us for meeting and solving problems in the next phase of our eternal existence.\nToday, as I contemplate the many, many blessings that have been given us, I recall the words of King Benjamin in the Book of Mormon when, after enumerating the blessings which had been poured down upon his people by the Lord, he said this to them: “And behold, all that he requires of you is to keep his commandments.” (Mosiah 2:22.) Yes, the only thing the Lord requires of us is that we keep his commandments! This sounds relatively simple, doesn’t it? But we all know that it isn’t simple, nor was it intended to be. Where much is given, much is expected. The Lord requires of those who dwell with him the ability to overcome weaknesses and imperfections. He requires self-denial and self-discipline.\nSome of us may feel from time to time that some of the Lord’s commandments are an impediment to happiness in this life, but this isn’t so; and deep down in our hearts we know that so long as we adhere to the commandments, just as surely as night follows day, we will reap the blessings that are promised to the faithful. Sometimes the way of fulfillment may not be apparent to us, but the actuality of it is assured. The Lord said:\n“I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise.” (D&C 82:10.)\nHow many of us on judgment day would like to be told that we had failed to do our part—that we had been unworthy servants of the Lord because our own lives had been such a poor example in keeping the commandments?\nIn Matthew 5:16 the Lord gives us a very important message:\n“Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.”\nTo fail to keep the commandments of the Lord not only brings condemnation, but actually deprives us of many blessings here on this earth—to say nothing of those eternal blessings for which we are all striving. In 1 Corinthians 2:9 we read this statement:\n“Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.”\nThink of that great promise. And finally, the wonderful promise given to all men:\n“And, if you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life, which gift is the greatest of the gifts of God.” (D&C 14:7.)\nOur late President Heber J. Grant told us how to endure to the end when he said:\n“Let us do the will of our Father in heaven today—we will then be prepared for the duties of tomorrow and for the eternities to come.”\nChrist repeatedly emphasized the fact that the gospel is one of work and service. To gain blessings, we must be doers of the word and not hearers only. In Matthew 7:21 we read: “Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.”\nThis means if we are to gain salvation, exaltation, and eternal life we must live in accordance with the principles of the gospel. We must love and forgive all men and keep the commandments of God.\nI leave my testimony with you today that I know the true gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored in this dispensation, that Joseph Smith was an instrument in the hands of the Lord in bringing this about. He was and is a prophet of God. I testify that we are led today by a prophet, President Harold B. Lee. May we all give him and his associates our love and support, and pray continually that they may be blessed with health, strength, and inspiration to carry their tremendous responsibilities. May we have courage and determination to keep the commandments and live in accordance with the principles of the gospel, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "year": 1973,
        "content": "May I share in the prayers expressed for all of us that I may say some words of encouragement to our youth.\nA Brigham Young University student wrote the editor of the following President Oaks’ recent address to the students on standards of dress and conduct: “Why must we always tag along behind the rest of the world, trying to get as close as our religion will let us? ‘A style of our own’ is not an empty phrase.”\nToday’s teenagers live in a world far different from that experienced by their parents. Though the world is becoming more wicked, the youth of Christ’s church can become more righteous if they understand who they are, understand the blessings available, and understand the promises God has made to those who are righteous, who believe, who endure. All of our youth are entitled to and need this knowledge to combat the forces of deception that would lead them captive into darkness.\nPeter, writing from Rome to the scattered saints, understood their trials and temptations to desert the faith and go back to their old ways. He encouraged the saints as he wrote: “That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth. …” (1 Pet. 1:7, italics added.)\nPeter then adds a broader dimension with stirring words to help us understand who we are when he wrote: “But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people;” and as a chosen and peculiar people, “… ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.” (1 Pet. 2:9, italics added.) What a wonderful declaration of identity for our youth to ponder—“chosen generation”—“royal priesthood”—“a peculiar people.”\nRecently, while attending a stake conference and having the added blessing of meeting with the young people, some of whom had driven long hours, I learned that several of them were the only Latter-day Saints in their high schools. When I asked, “You set the right example for the rest of the students, don’t you?” they replied, “We really try.” As they said “we really try,” I could see the light of belief and conviction in those youthful faces. I could begin to understand what Peter meant by our being “called out of the darkness into his marvellous light.”\nOur youth, with all of their distractions, must realize that through their membership they are very special; that the Lord is counting on them that the prophecies might be fulfilled. You of a noble birthright are different from your friends who are not members of Christ’s true church. You are a “chosen generation”; you live “in the world” but you do not follow worldly trends or habits which are contrary to your beliefs. May I remind you of only a few of the very special events in your life that cause you to be different. You have made some promises, and some eternal promises have been made to you.\n(a) Many of you were born under the covenant, your parents having made a covenant with God. You can, if worthy, “… inherit thrones, kingdoms, principalities,” and have “… exaltation and glory … sealed upon [your] heads, … forever and ever.” (D&C 132:19.) Chances are your nonmember friends wouldn’t understand these terms. In today’s world they may sound rather strange.\n(b) You have been baptized “even by water, and … of fire and of the Holy Ghost” (D&C 33:11), making your salvation possible if you endure and are faithful to the end.\n(c) You partake of the sacrament at our meetings, symbolic of the torn flesh and spilled blood of our Savior, giving you an opportunity to renew your covenant to keep the Lord’s commandments that his spirit may continue to be with you as it did with a teenage girl in Scotland who told of being with nonmember friends. She wanted to be part of the group and thought, “Surely one little drink wouldn’t hurt—why not?” Then she realized her celestial kingdom goal. After that, she said, the ridicule didn’t matter. She had felt of his spirit and could feel of his influence at that moment.\nYou are surrounded with temptation and wickedness, but you don’t succumb to them. A Chinese scholar wrote: “The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor man perfected without trials.”\n(d) You young men have received the priesthood of God with the authority to perform special ordinances in his name, this right delegated to you, to be his fully qualified servants with the power to bind on earth and in heaven—to administer spiritual things.\nJust this week we received a letter from a mother telling of her Navy son, now stationed on a small island 1,200 miles south of India out in the Indian Ocean. It has only the military base and a small coconut plantation. This young man has located six other LDS boys and they are now holding regular Church services. He wrote his mother telling of his opportunity now to prepare lessons for their priesthood meetings—young men on a tiny speck of land in a vast ocean recognizing and using their priesthood authority. They are different.\nThe Lord said:\n“For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies.” (D&C 84:33.)\nSuch an experience these young men are having!\n(e) You can, if you qualify, go to the temple with your sweetheart—the one you love dearly—to be married in a manner prescribed by the Lord to continue forever as husband and wife in the celestial kingdom of God; and, if you live worthily, to gain eternal life—the greatest of all God’s gifts to man.\nAt times I wonder if you fully comprehend the far-reaching, eternal significance of temple marriage. If you really understand, you will never settle for less. Marriage is a divine ordinance, not to be performed by a justice of the peace or to be taken lightly; but, “… ordained of God unto man.” (D&C 49:15.)\n(f) You can, if worthy, even perform miracles—which makes you different from the rest of your friends; to heal the sick, cure all manner of disease. Healings are among the signs that follow true believers. Faithful young elders have this power.\nThese are only a few of the eternal principles that distinguish you from the materialistic style being developed by worldly men today. As you place the weight of your influence on the side of good, truth, and beauty, your life will achieve an endless splendor, nobler than you might imagine.\nPaul, writing to his beloved Timothy and realizing the pressure Timothy was experiencing, said: “… God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.” (2 Tim. 1:7.)\nSome of you attend schools where there are few Church members; others, where we are a majority. But if you conduct yourselves properly and develop your personalities along Church standards, your candle will be high on a hill and will burn brightly for all to see. Dare to think for yourself. Have the strength of character to act the way you know to be right.\nDebbi Brown, the only Mormon in her Roanoke, Virginia, high school senior class, said: “It is so important for us to live the standards of the Church. Most people who know anything about our Church know that it maintains the highest moral standards.\n“There is never a need to apologize. We are so lucky to have the true gospel. By making the Church standards our standards, we can share this gospel with others.”\nShe continues: “A good friend (not a member of our church) invited me to a party celebrating our victorious football season. He was a popular football player. I was hesitant. He knew I was a Mormon. My hesitation must have been evident. He quickly added, ‘No drinking allowed.’ People know our standards and respect us for them. To be different from the crowd is a privilege.”\nNow to our young friends, you may feel at times that the Lord’s commandments restrict your freedom as compared with others. Freedom does not mean license, nor does it imply the absence of all restrictions and discipline. The Savior did not teach undisciplined, permissive-type freedom. When he said, “know the truth, and the truth shall make you free” (John 8:32), he is telling us that his truth, if followed, would free us from falsity, from deception; that his gospel, if followed, would free us to gain eternal life. As the light of the gospel fills our souls, our abilities will increase. We will love our neighbors and be of sincere service in helping others.\nWe have a young military chaplain, a former missionary who is happily married, who lives the gospel as he should. His superior officer at his first duty assignment was so impressed with his spirit that he wrote: “I want you to know how much we chaplains and the thousands of men have appreciated his presence. To describe him like a breath of fresh, clean air would be poetic and not intended to demean other chaplains who labor at our large base. He has a special charisma that radiates love.”\nThe officer then went on to say: “We have benefited in many ways from this young chaplain. We not only admire him but renew our own enthusiasm. Thousands have derived great spiritual and social benefit from his service.”\nI testify to our noble youth who will be the future leaders of our society and the Church that you are different. You need not look just like the world; you need not entertain like the world; your personal habits should be different; your recreation will be different; your concern for your family will be vastly different. If you establish this distinctiveness firmly in your life pattern, only blessings await you for doing what is right.\nIt is written: “If you speak and act with pure thoughts, happiness will follow like a shadow.” (Anonymous.)\nRemember, my young friends, that Christ is the only one through whom we can reach the divine destiny. You and I must believe in him—believe that his Church was founded and established upon divine revelation, that we have presiding over his Church a true and living prophet through whom revelation is received for the world today—for all of his people—now—today—1973.\nPresident Harold B. Lee sits here with us now. We have heard his voice, listened to his counsel and wisdom, knowing we will never be led astray, but encouraged by him to live as we should, to obey God’s commandments down to the latest day.\nPresident Lee once remarked that President Heber J. Grant counseled: “Brethren, keep your eye on the President of this Church. If he tells you to do anything and it is wrong and you do it, the Lord will bless you for it. But you don’t need to worry; the Lord will never let his mouthpiece lead this people astray.” (Brigham Young University address, April 19, 1961, quoted in the October, 1972, p. 7.)\nPresident Lee recently said in a most moving address to the Brigham Young University student body: “The measure of your true conviction is whether or not you see the power of God resting on the leaders of this Church and that testimony goes down into your heart like fire.” May these words of his have a deep impact on all, but especially on you—our youth. The world may not comprehend what he said, but you can. You are different. You are a chosen generation. May you see the power of God resting on him as His prophet, as I testify to you it does, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "I feel confident, brothers and sisters, that we are most grateful for the splendid and timely message given by President Lee in this morning’s session of conference. He gave encouragement and counsel for all of us to walk uprightly before the Lord and to keep his laws and commandments. It is the only way we can find our way to the eternal life that God has held out to the faithful of his people. In fact, our God gave this promise: “… if you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God.” (D&C 14:7.)\n“Behold, he that hath eternal life is rich.” (D&C 6:7.) Very few people give enough thought to eternal life. Yet it is something each of us should keep uppermost in our minds and hearts. As children of God, we cannot afford to forget our origin and destiny if we desire the realms of celestial glory.\nThrough revelation, God has given the gospel plan of salvation and exaltation for men to live by. Eternal life is God’s life, which he hopes to share with all his children. But we are free to act for ourselves, “… to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great mediation of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.” (2 Ne. 2:27.)\nThe first step on the path to eternal life is baptism. Our Savior set the example when he went into the water with John the Baptist, who was authorized of God to baptize Jesus by immersion. This sets the mode of baptism for all men to follow.\nThe apostle Paul taught that there is “one Lord, one faith, one baptism.” (Eph. 4:5.)\nChrist is the one Lord, the gospel plan taught by him is the one faith, and his baptism by immersion is the one baptism.\nNephi, a Book of Mormon prophet, stated it this way: “… For the gate by which ye should enter is repentance and baptism by water; and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost.\n“And then are ye in this straight and narrow path which leads to eternal life. …” (2 Ne. 31:17–18.)\n“Enter ye in at the strait gate: …” said our Lord, “because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.” (Matt. 7:13–14.)\nChrist made this positive statement: “I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” (John 14:6.) If we believe in Christ and his mission, we cannot bypass him and obtain eternal life. The Savior gave his life as an atoning sacrifice for the sins of the world, thus opening the door for man who, through faithfulness, may gain eternal life and exaltation.\nHowever, conversion and baptism alone are not sufficient to one’s assurance of eternal life. To receive exaltation in the kingdom of God, a person must abide the fulness of celestial law. (See D&C 76:50–70.)\nSome people erroneously think if they receive all the ordinances of the gospel, regardless of their transgressions, they will inherit the celestial mansions of our God. What a rude awakening awaits such false-thinking individuals, “… for the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance.” (Alma 45:16.)\nListen to the teachings of Nephi on this subject: “Yea, and there shall be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die; and it shall be well with us.\n“And there shall also be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and be merry; nevertheless, fear God—he will justify in committing a little sin; yea, lie a little, take the advantage of one because of his words, dig a pit for thy neighbor; there is no harm in this; and do all these things, for tomorrow we die; and if it so be that we are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes, and at last we shall be saved in the kingdom of God.\n“Yea, and there shall be many which shall teach after this manner, false and vain and foolish doctrines, and shall be puffed up in their hearts, and shall seek deep to hide their counsels from the Lord; and their works shall be in the dark.” (2 Ne. 28:7–9.)\nWe must not fall to the misleading precepts of man and foolishly break God’s laws and thus lose our opportunity for exaltation. Jesus stated:\n“Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.” (Matt. 7:21.)\nA person earnestly seeking eternal life must avoid the pitfalls of temptation and sin. He is never safe from committing sin unless he has fully prepared himself and decided on the course he will take before temptation comes into his life.\nThere are two great opposite forces at work in the world. One is the force of evil which takes away man’s agency, destroys freedoms, and makes the nonvaliant a follower of Satan; which can only lead to unhappiness in life and eternal misery. The second is the force of God. This is the power to do good; to live righteously, to enjoy freedom of choice, and to be courageous, faithful followers of Christ through whom only is salvation and exaltation assured.\nWe should determine whose side we are on and then have the courage, in spite of evil persuasion, to faithfully stay on the Lord’s side.\nWe cannot mix evil with good and attain the eternal mansions of our Heavenly Father. Our duty is to constantly do the works of righteousness. The Lord has said that light and truth, which is the word of God, forsake the evil one. (See D&C 93:37.) Without light and truth in our lives, we are subject to the powers of Satan.\nWe must be ever aware of the deceiving servants of the Satanic hosts. The stratagems of Satan are many to entrap mankind in his powerful clutches. Some of the more obvious ones are apathy, complacency, immorality, drugs, greed for money, dishonesty, and corruptive practices.\nThe Savior taught his disciples: “No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.” (Matt. 6:24.)\nThis can be stated another way: You cannot serve both God and Satan. Life is a real challenge, but blessed with God-given powers, we can overcome every stratagem and obstacle Satan may place in our path. The path to eternal life may not be an easy one to follow with all the worldly enticements about us, but when we consider the rewards and blessings we gather if we travel the narrow way, it is worth every sacrifice we make.\nAlma taught his people that this life is the time for men to perform their labors and to prepare for eternity. He warned those who procrastinate their repentance: “Ye cannot say, when ye are brought to that awful crisis, that I will repent, that I will return to my God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world.\n“For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance even until death, behold, ye have become subjected to the spirit of the devil, … therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you. …” (Alma 34:34–35.)\nWe need the constant companionship of the Holy Spirit. Without it we are deprived of its spiritual guidance and lose our sense of eternal values and drift further into disbelief and evil practices.\nThe Lord is displeased with those who do not forsake their wicked ways, the pride of their hearts, their covetousness, and all their detestable things, which keep them from the eternal life he has offered unto them. (See D&C 98:20.)\n“But this much I can tell you,” said King Benjamin to his people, “that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith … even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish. And now, O man, remember, and perish not.” (Mosiah 4:30.)\nThe invitation for eternal life is open to all who are willing to pay the price. The Lord has said: “Yea, blessed are they … who have obeyed my gospel; for they shall receive for their reward the good things of the earth, … and … shall also be crowned with the blessings from above … they that are faithful and diligent before me.” (D&C 59:3–4.)\nEntering into sacred covenants and obligations with God is not all that is required. Nephi stated: “And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this straight and narrow path, I would ask if all is done? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.\n“Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.” (2 Ne. 31:19–20.)\nWe cannot stand idly by, being merely an interested spectator, rather than a participating member, and still receive the blessing of eternal life. It is our duty to gain an appropriate witness and testimony which will change and improve our lives for good.\nThe gift of eternal life cannot be obtained outside of the Church established by the Father and the Son. The church set up by Christ in the meridian of time became apostate following the ministry of his apostles, and thus was steeped in error by false gospel teachings, changing ordinances, and loss of divine authority. The same condition prevailed during the dark ages, requiring a new gospel dispensation—the restoration of Christ’s church to earth. I testify this restoration occurred in the year 1830, through the Prophet Joseph Smith.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints stands firmly on divine principles of eternal truth. It is meeting the temporal and spiritual needs of its members. It is not liberalizing its standards nor the teachings of Christ. Mormonism is growing because of its disciplines. The old-fashioned virtues of honesty, integrity, morality, and fidelity are God-given standards to live by. Unfortunately, these qualities are fast disappearing in the world, and wickedness is rising.\nI bear witness there is a future life that holds much in promise for the faithful of God’s children. It is time for all men to turn fully to God. Our trust and faith in him assures his protective care and guiding influence which will lead us, if faithful and true, to his holy presence.\nI hope, brothers and sisters, we will all be worthy of this wonderful gift and blessing. I know God lives. I know this is his church. I know it is directed by divine inspiration. We are most blessed in having a living prophet in our beloved Harold B. Lee. He is a great individual and one whom we can admire, respect, and look up to for teaching, counsel, and guidance. May God bless us to be faithful and true to all the covenants and obligations we have entered into with him, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "My beloved brothers and sisters, far and near, members of the Church and nonmembers:\nThe first Article of Faith of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints reads: “We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.”\nLast spring in general conference I spoke about “God, the Eternal Father.” Today I shall speak about “His Son, Jesus Christ,” our Redeemer. Since this is such a sacred theme I invite each of you to join with me in a prayer that our Heavenly Father will help each of us to get a deeper understanding and a greater appreciation of his Only Begotten Son—our Savior.\nChronologically, we get our earliest information about Jesus from the scriptures, which tell of a great pre-earth council attended by the spirit children of God. In that council the Father’s plan for man’s eternal progression was presented. Whereupon, Jesus volunteered and was appointed to make the atonement required to make possible man’s salvation and exaltation. Abraham records the proceedings of that council as he had seen them in vision.\n“Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham,” he says, “the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones;\n“And God saw these souls that they were good, … for he stood among those that were spirits. …” (Abr. 3:22–23.)\nIn the following lines from his “Elias: An Epic of the Ages,” the late Elder Orson F. Whitney paraphrased what Abraham and other seers have revealed concerning the proceedings and consequences of that heavenly council and the role Jesus played in it. Now listen to these majestic lines of Brother Whitney:\n\n“In solemn council sat the Gods, …\n\n“… That awful hour was one\nWhen thought doth most avail;\nOf worlds unborn the destiny\nHung trembling in the scale.\nSilence self-spelled; and there arose,\nThose kings and priests among,\nA power sublime, than whom appeared\nNone nobler ’mid the throng.\n\n“A stature mingling strength with grace,\nOf meek though godlike mien;\nThe glory of whose countenance\nOutshone the noonday sheen. …\nHe spake;—attention grew more grave,\nThe stillness e’en more still.\n\n“‘Father!’—the voice like music fell, …\n‘Father,’ it said, ‘since one must die,\nThy children to redeem,\nFrom spheres all formless now and void,\nWhere pulsing life shall teem;\n\n“‘And mighty Michael [Adam] foremost fall\nThat mortal man may be;\nAnd chosen saviour Thou must send,\nLo, here am I—send me!\nI ask, I seek no recompense,\nSave that which then were mine;\nMine be the willing sacrifice,\nThe endless glory Thine! …’\n\n“Still rang that voice, when sudden rose\nAloft a towering form,\nProudly erect as lowering peak\n’Lumed by the gathering storm; …\n\n“‘Send me!’ coiled ’neath his courtly smile\nA scarce concealed disdain—\n‘And none shall hence, from heaven to earth,\nThat shall not rise again.\nMy saving plan exception scorns.\nMan’s will?—Nay, mine alone.\nAs recompense, I claim the right\nTo sit on yonder Throne!’\n\n“Ceased Lucifer. The breathless hush\nResumed and denser grew.\nAll eyes were turned; the general gaze\nOne common magnet drew.\nA moment there was solemn pause—\nListened eternity,\nWhile rolled from lips omnipotent\nThe Father’s firm decree:\n\n“‘Jehovah, thou my Messenger!\nSon Ahman, thee I send;\nAnd one shall go thy face before,\nWhile twelve thy steps attend.\nAnd many more on that far shore\nThe pathway shall prepare,\nThat I, the first, the last may come,\nAnd earth my glory share. …\n\n“‘Go forth, thou Chosen of the Gods,\nWhose strength shall in thee dwell!\nGo down betime and rescue earth,\nDethroning death and hell.\nOn thee alone man’s fate depends,\nThe fate of beings all.\nThou shalt not fail, though thou art free—\nFree, but too great to fall.\n\n“‘By arm divine, both mine and thine,\nThe lost thou shalt restore,\nAnd man, redeemed, with God shall be,\nAs God forevermore.\nReturn, and to the parent fold\nThis wandering planet bring,\nAnd earth shall hail thee Conqueror,\nAnd heaven proclaim thee King.’\n\n“’Twas done. From congregation vast,\nTumultuous murmurs rose;\nWaves of conflicting sound, as when\nTwo meeting seas oppose.\n’Twas finished. But the heavens wept;\nAnd still their annals tell\nHow one was choice of Elohim,\nO’er one who fighting fell.”\n\nAll the prophets, from Adam to President Harold B. Lee, our present prophet, have testified that Jesus Christ, the firstborn spirit Son of God, was so chosen to be and is our Redeemer.\nThe prophets who preceded Jesus into mortality bore witness to the fact that he had been so chosen and that he would come to earth and fulfill his mission.\nIn the very beginning, as Adam offered sacrifice in obedience to divine command, “… an angel of the Lord appeared unto [him], saying: Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said unto him: I know not, save the Lord commanded me.\n“And then the angel spake, saying: This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father. …” (Moses 5:6–7.)\nFrom that time until Christ’s mortal ministry, all people who understood God’s plan for man’s eternal progression offered like sacrifice. This the Father required them to do that they might constantly be reminded of the coming of Christ and the atonement he would make in his role as Redeemer.\nThe Lord further said to Adam:\n“… If thou wilt turn unto me, and hearken unto my voice, and believe, and repent of all thy transgressions, and be baptized, even in water, in the name of mine Only Begotten Son, who is full of grace and truth, which is Jesus Christ, the only name which shall be given under heaven, whereby salvation shall come unto the children of men, ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. …” (Moses 6:52.)\n“Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son, and thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore.\n“And Adam and Eve … made all things known unto their sons and their daughters.” (Moses 5:8, 12.)\nFrom Adam to the meridian of time the inhabitants of the earth were repeatedly reminded of God’s divine program for the salvation of men—the gospel of Jesus Christ. Enoch, Noah, Melchizedek, Abraham, Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and other prophets taught it.\nDuring the 2,000 years immediately preceding the birth of Christ there flourished in America two great civilizations. To them also the mission of Christ was made known. The Book of Mormon reveals the fact that to one of the leaders of a colony being divinely led from “the great tower” to America, “the Lord showed himself … and said … :\n“Behold, I am he who was prepared from the foundation of the world to redeem my people. Behold, I am Jesus Christ. … In me shall all mankind have light, and that eternally, even they who shall believe on my name. …\n“Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; … and even as I appear unto thee to be in the spirit will I appear unto my people in the flesh.” (Ether 3:13–14, 16.)\nThe Book of Mormon further records that some 2,200 years later, on the night before Christ was born, “the voice of the Lord came unto” another American prophet, saying:\n“Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for behold, the time is at hand, … and on the morrow come I into the world, to show unto the world that I will fulfill all that which I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of my holy prophets.” (3 Ne. 1:13.)\nEvery one of us, of course, knows of the angelic announcement on the fields of Bethlehem, “For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.” (Luke 2:11.)\nBoth the Father and the Son have repeatedly born convincing witness that Jesus is our Redeemer. At Christ’s baptism the Father said: “… Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased” (Luke 3:22); and later on the Mount of Transfiguration, “… This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him” (Matt. 17:5).\nThe New Testament repeatedly makes record of Christ’s own witness to his identity and mission. One of the most impressive declarations of both the Father and the Son was to the Nephites in America, whom Christ visited following the close of his post-resurrection ministry in the land of Jerusalem. To them the Father introduced the resurrected Jesus with these words:\n“Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name—hear ye him.” (3 Ne. 11:7.)\nWhereupon, Jesus himself, the resurrected Jesus, descended from heaven “… and stood in the midst of them. …\n“… and spake unto [them], saying:\n“Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world.” (3 Ne. 11:8–10.)\n“Behold, I have come unto the world to bring redemption unto the world, to save the world from sin.\n“Therefore, whoso repenteth and cometh unto me as a little child, him will I receive; … therefore repent, and come unto me ye ends of the earth, and be saved.” (3 Ne. 9:21–22.)\nSince time will permit but one more testimony to Christ’s appointment and mission as Redeemer, I now want to bear my own testimony.\nI bear personal witness to the truth of all the testimonies I have cited. I testify that through the atonement wrought by Jesus Christ men are to be resurrected to immortality and, conditioned upon obedience to the gospel of Jesus Christ, to eternal life.\nI know that Jesus Christ was the firstborn spirit child of God the Father; that he is the Only Begotten Son of God in the flesh; that, as the scriptures teach, in the spirit world before this earth was created he sponsored the Father’s plan for the mortality, the death, the resurrection, and the eternal life of men; that, commissioned of the Father, he was the creator of this earth; the Jehovah of the Old Testament, “the God of Adam and of Noah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of Israel, the God at whose instance the prophets of the ages have spoken, the God of all nations, and [that] He shall yet reign on earth as King of kings and Lord of lords.” (James E. Talmage, p. 4.)\nHe came to earth as the Babe of Bethlehem, begotten of the Father, born of Mary; the gospel he taught is the one and only means by which men can fulfill the full measure of their creation. “His immaculate life in the flesh” and “his voluntary death as a consecrated sacrifice for the sins of mankind,” with his victory over death, secured for all men resurrection and immortality and, upon the conditions specified by him, eternal life.\nI bear personal witness to these truths and to the further fact that in the spring of 1820 this same Jesus Christ, in company with his Father, appeared to Joseph Smith, Jr., in a grove near Palmyra, New York, in one of the greatest theophanies ever given to man. The Prophet thus spoke of it:\n“… When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!” (JS—H 1:17.)\nJesus is as he said, “the life and light of the world” (D&C 10:70); “… Jesus Christ is the name which is given of the Father, and there is none other name given whereby man can be saved” (D&C 18:23). His “Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world” and continues to enlighten “every man through the world, that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit.\n“… every one that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit cometh unto God, even the Father.” (D&C 84:46–47.)\nI further testify that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints—presently presided over by the Lord’s prophet, President Harold B. Lee—is Christ’s church, established at his direction, endowed with his authority, and charged by him to teach his gospel and administer its saving ordinances, all to the end that men may qualify for the blessings, joy and glory placed within their reach by Jesus Christ, their Lord and their Redeemer. I bear witness to all these things in the holy name of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. Amen."

        "content": "If the Lord himself had chosen to come down, open the conference, and address the Saints, what message would he have delivered? If he had elected and chosen to come and speak at this session, what word would he have given us for our blessing and benefit and salvation?\nSuch an appearance is not wholly outside the realm of possibility. The Prophet Joseph Smith said that if we would come together and strip ourselves of jealousies and have perfect faith, that the veil might as well be rent today as at any time. (See D&C 67:10; p. 9.) I think that when the Lord dwelt in the city of Enoch, without question he spoke in their congregations; and when in due course he will reign in millennial splendor on the earth, he will do exactly the same thing again.\nBut we also operate under the principle that the word of eternal truth which is given to the children of men, whether it comes by his own voice or the voice of his servants, it is the same. And I had it impressed upon me, when President Lee opened the conference yesterday, and again when President Romney bore the persuasive and powerful and true witness that has just come from his lips, that if the Lord himself were here, those statements which came from them are the very things that he would say at this time.\nThese brethren who stand in the First Presidency of the Church are the Lord’s agents, his representatives. They hold the keys of the kingdom of God on earth at this hour and from them come the words of life and truth and revelation that will give us, if we conform to them, peace in this life and eternal glory in the life to come.\nNow I desire very much to have the same spirit attend me that has rested so mightily upon these others who have stood here so that what I say will be what the Lord wants said on this occasion. I desire, if I may be so guided, to counsel the Latter-day Saints to take an affirmative, wholesome attitude toward world and national conditions; to turn their backs on everything that is evil and destructive; to look for that which is good and edifying in all things; to praise the Lord for his goodness and grace in giving us the glories and wonders of his everlasting gospel.\nIn view of all that prevails in the world, it might be easy to center our attention on negative or evil things, or to dissipate our energies on causes and enterprises of doubtful worth and questionable productivity.\nI am fully aware of the divine decree to be actively engaged in a good cause; of the fact that every true principle which works for the freedom and blessing of mankind has the Lord’s approval; of the need to sustain and support those who espouse proper causes and advocate true principles—all of which things we also should do in the best and most beneficial way we can. The issue, I think, is not what we should do but how we should do it; and I maintain that the most beneficial and productive thing which Latter-day Saints can do to strengthen every good and proper cause is to live and teach the principles of the everlasting gospel.\nThere may be those who have special gifts and needs to serve in other fields, but as far as I am concerned, with the knowledge and testimony that I have, there is nothing I can do for the time and season of this mortal probation that is more important than to use all my strength, energy and ability in spreading and perfecting the cause of truth and righteousness, both in the Church and among our Father’s other children.\nI think the Latter-day Saints have a great obligation pressing in upon them to rejoice in the Lord, to praise him for his goodness and grace, to ponder his eternal truths in their hearts, and to set their hearts on righteousness.\nNow for a text I take these words of Isaiah, words which he addressed to us, to the House of Israel, to the members of the Lord’s Kingdom. He asked:\n“… Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?” (Isa. 33:14.)\nThat is, who in the Church shall gain an inheritance in the celestial kingdom? Who will go where God and Christ and holy beings are? Who will overcome the world, work the works of righteousness, and enduring in faith and devotion to the end hear the blessed benediction, “Come, and inherit the kingdom of my Father.”\nIsaiah answers:\n“He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil; He shall dwell on high. …” (Isa. 33:15–16.)\nNow if I may, I shall take these words of Isaiah, spoken by the power of the Holy Ghost in the first instance, and give some indication as to how they apply to us and our circumstances.\nFirst, “He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly.” That is, building on the atoning sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ, we must keep the commandments. We must speak the truth and work the works of righteousness. We shall be judged by our thoughts, our words and our deeds.\nSecond, “… he that despiseth the gain of oppressions.” That is, we must act with equity and justice toward our fellowmen. It is the Lord himself who said that he, at the day of his coming, will be a swift witness against those that oppress the hireling in his wages.\nThird, “… he that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes.” That is, we must reject every effort to buy influence, and instead deal fairly and impartially with our fellowmen. God is no respecter of persons. He esteemeth all flesh alike; and those only who keep his commandments find special favor with him. Salvation is free; it cannot be purchased with money; and those only are saved who abide the law upon which its receipt is predicated. Bribery is of the world.\nFourth, he “… that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil.” That is, we must not center our attention on evil and wickedness. We must cease to find fault and look for good in government and in the world. We must take an affirmative, wholesome approach to all things.\nThere is an eternal law, ordained by God himself before the foundations of the world, that every man shall reap as he sows. If we think evil thoughts, our tongues will utter unclean sayings. If we speak words of wickedness, we shall end up doing the works of wickedness. If our minds are centered on the carnality and evil of the world, then worldliness and unrighteousness will seem to us to be the normal way of life. If we ponder things related to sex immorality in our minds, we will soon think everybody is immoral and unclean and it will break down the barrier between us and the world. And so with every other unwholesome, unclean, impure, and ungodly course. And so it is that the Lord says he hates and esteems as an abomination, “an heart that deviseth wicked imaginations. …” (Prov. 6:18.)\nOn the other hand, if we are pondering in our hearts the things of righteousness, we shall become righteous. If virtue garnishes our thoughts unceasingly, our confidence shall wax strong in the presence of God and he in turn will rain down righteousness upon us. Truly as Jacob said, “… to be carnally-minded is death, and to be spiritually-minded is life eternal.” (2 Ne. 9:39.) And as Paul said, “Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.” (Gal. 6:7–8.)\nAnd yet again from Paul:\n“… whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.” (Philip. 4:8.)\nTo enable us to keep our minds centered on righteousness, we should consciously elect to ponder the truths of salvation in our hearts. Brother Packer yesterday pleaded with eloquence that we sing the songs of Zion in order to center our thoughts on wholesome things. I would like to add that we can also—after we have had the opening song—call on ourselves to preach a sermon. I have preached many sermons walking along congested city streets, or tramping desert trails, or in lonely places, thus centering my mind on the Lord’s affairs and the things of righteousness; and I might say they have been better sermons than I have ever preached to congregations.\nIf we are going to work out our salvation, we must rejoice in the Lord. We must ponder his truths in our hearts. We must rivet our attention and interests upon him and his goodness to us. We must forsake the world and use all our strength, energies and abilities in furthering his work.\nI think the Lord’s people should rejoice in him and shout praises to his holy name. Cries of hosannah should ascend from our lips continually. When I think of the revealed knowledge we have about him whom it is life eternal to know, and of the great plan of salvation which he ordained for us; when I think about his Beloved Son, who bought us with his blood, and who brought life and immortality to light through his atoning sacrifice; when I think of the life and ministry of the Prophet Joseph Smith, who has done more save Jesus only for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man who ever lived in it, and who crowned his mortal ministry with a martyr’s death—my soul wells up with eternal gratitude and I desire to raise my voice with the choirs above in ceaseless praise to him who dwells on high.\nWhen I think that the Lord has a living oracle guiding his earthly kingdom, and that there are apostles and prophets who walk the earth again; when I think that the Lord has given us the gift and power of the Holy Ghost so that we have the revelations of heaven and the power to sanctify our souls; when I think of the unnumbered blessings—the gifts, the miracles, the promise that the family unit shall go on everlastingly, all the blessings that are poured out upon us, and offered freely to all men everywhere—my desire to praise the Lord and proclaim his goodness and grace knows no bounds. And so in this spirit of praise and thanksgiving, which is the same spirit that attended the expressions made by President Romney this morning, I shall conclude with these words of my own psalm:\n\nPraise ye the Lord:\nPraise him for his goodness;\nPraise him for his grace;\nExalt his name and seek his face—\nO praise ye the Lord.\n\nBlessed is the Lord:\nBless him for his mercy;\nBless him for his love;\nExalt his name and seek his face—\nO blessed is the Lord.\n\nPraise ye the Lord:\nPraise him who all things did create;\nPraise him who all things did redeem;\nExalt his name and seek his face—\nO praise ye the Lord.\n\nSeek ye the Lord:\nSeek him who rules on high;\nSeek him whose will we know;\nExalt his name and seek his face—\nO seek ye the Lord.\n\nAnd we have the promise that if we seek him with full purpose of heart, keeping his commandments and walking uprightly before him, we shall indeed see his face and eventually be inheritors with him of eternal life in his Father’s kingdom. Of this I testify, and for this I pray for all of us, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "In about the year a.d. 30 there came to the banks of the River Jordan a man—young, strong, and rustic in appearance. He began to baptize people, but he was not like others who were baptizing in Jordan; and there were others, for they baptized only to bring people into their particular religious sect.\nHe was different. He preached repentance from sin and said that he baptized for repentance, but that there would come one after him who would baptize with fire and with the Holy Ghost, one who would be so much greater than he, John, that he would not be worthy to perform the most menial of tasks, that of stooping down and loosening the fastenings of his sandals.\nSo powerful was John’s preaching and so important was the message he bore that people flocked to him to be taught and to be baptized.\nIn addition he bore witness that they must do good, must share their goods with the poor; and he witnessed that they were about to see their salvation.\nThose who heard him were much affected by what he said, and some asked him if he were the Christ. (See Luke 3:11–15.)\nThen one day there came to him a man asking to be baptized. When John saw him, he recognized him to be the Son of God and protested that the situation should be reversed. He said: “… I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?” (Matt. 3:14.) The Lord, for it truly was he, said: “Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness. …” (Matt. 3:15.)\nThen John witnessed that the Holy Ghost fell upon Jesus like a dove, and he heard the voice of the Father from heaven say: “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” (Matt. 3:17.)\nIn this manner the earthly work of the Lord began. A prophet testified and identified him, after which the voice of God confirmed the identification.\nYou have already heard from Brother Romney of the beginning, when the preexistent Savior appeared to the brother of Jared, and I shall not repeat that. You have also heard how in the beginning Adam was taught to make a sacrifice, the reason for it being that the Lord Jesus Christ was that sacrifice to be consummated in the meridian of time.\nIt was the purpose of the Father and the plan that men on earth should not forget what Adam taught. There was to be a Savior, and he was to do what his father intended—to be a lamb without blemish slain from before the foundation of the world—that is, the whole plan for the sacrifice of the Savior and for the redemption of men on earth was completed long before the earth was made.\nEnoch asked the Lord when the great sacrifice would be made and was told that it would “be in the meridian of time, in the days of wickedness and vengeance.” (Moses 7:46.)\nBy the mouths of the prophets as the time drew closer to the eventful year, the Lord spelled out to the people how they might know of the coming of the true Redeemer. Witness: “Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.” (Isa. 7:14.)\nHe was to be despised and rejected and bruised for our iniquity. He was to bear our grief and carry our sorrows; he was himself to be a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief. He was to be brought as a lamb to the slaughter, yet he would open not his mouth, even as sheep brought to be sheared are dumb. He was to make his grave with the wicked and the rich. He was to be an offering for sin. (See Isa. 53.)\nIt was prophesied also that this son should “be called Wonderful, Counsellor,” and with a final burst of inspired words Isaiah revealed him as “The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.” (Isa. 9:6.)\nAnd now in our day, our message is that once more the voice of God, the Eternal Father, has been heard. In this dispensation he has revealed himself in his own glory, his majesty, his person. With him also was revealed his Beloved Son Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, the Counseler and Wonderful of Isaiah; the Lord who met Moses on the mountain amid thunderings and lightnings; the Lord who stood transfigured with glory before Peter and James and John on the mount; who, having arisen on the third day, after suffering the most painful death ever devised by man, appeared to Mary, then to the eleven apostles, and later to upwards of 500; and who, after a cloud had received him out of their sight, sent an angel to tell them that he would return even as he had ascended into heaven.\nThe visit of these two to Joseph Smith, their persons filling the forest aisle with heavenly light, testified that indeed they live. The young prophet heard the heavenly voice of the Father affirm his Son: “… this is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!” (JS—H 1:17.) Joseph Smith heard! He saw! He bore solemn testimony of the great revelation.\nWe bear witness that this revelation is true. From that glorious morning until now The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which Joseph Smith was commanded to organize, has journeyed 143 years on its divine and destined mission to fill the earth.\nWe invite all men to listen to the message of salvation which is offered by the Lord through his servants, some of whom you have heard yesterday and today. By repentance from sin and baptism by immersion by those having divine authority from the Lord, anyone may find the peace which the Lord has promised to those who will accept him and obey his word.\nYou may ask: “How may I know The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the true church which Christ the Lord accepts as his?” He, the Lord, has prepared an infallible witness that you may know. Nearly four thousand years ago the Lord began to prepare this witness by showing himself as a preexistent spirit to the brother of Jared, a prophetic leader in the days of the Tower of Babel. The Lord inspired his people who followed this prophet to be led to America, an unknown land in that day; and later he caused groups of the House of Israel in Palestine to migrate also. Of them all he commanded that records be kept of their travels and their knowledge of the Lord.\nAt the appointed time, his birth in Bethlehem was marked in America by three days of light in which there was no darkness, and at his crucifixion there were three days of total darkness with mighty destruction of the wicked and their cities and habitations. The righteous received a visit from the Lord. Listen to the description given by the prophet who compiled the record:\n“… they heard a voice as if it came out of heaven; and they cast their eyes round about, for they understood not the voice which they heard; and it was not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice; nevertheless, and notwithstanding it being a small voice it did pierce them that did hear to the center, insomuch that there was no part of their frame that it did not cause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did cause their hearts to burn.\n“And it came to pass that again they heard the voice, and they understood it not. …\n“And behold, the third time they did understand the voice which they heard; and it said unto them:\n“Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name—hear ye him.\n“And it came to pass, as they understood they cast their eyes up again towards heaven; and behold, they saw a Man descending out of heaven; and he was clothed in a white robe; and he came down and stood in the midst of them; …\n“And it came to pass that he stretched forth his hand and spake unto the people, saying:\n“Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world.\n“And behold, I am the light and the life of the world. …” (3 Ne. 11:3–4, 6–11.)\nI shall not take time to describe his visit except to say that he taught them his gospel and organized his church here in America among them. He taught the same principles as he had taught in his earthly ministry in Palestine. He blessed their children and blessed them, stating that he would come again. You will be interested to know that the promise to come again lingers in the legends handed down to this day by the descendants of those people. Cortez easily conquered Mexico because the Mexican people thought he was that God returning.\nMoroni, the last prophet to keep the records, seeing the destruction of the people by war and contention about four hundred years later, said:\n“And now I, Moroni, bid farewell unto the Gentiles, yea, and also unto my brethren whom I love, until we shall meet before the judgment-seat of Christ, where all men shall know that my garments are not spotted with your blood.\n“And then shall ye know that I have seen Jesus, and that he hath talked with me face to face, and that he told me in plain humility, even as a man telleth another in mine own language, concerning these things.” (Ether 12:38–39.)\nThis prophet sealed his record and deposited it in a stone box in a hill. In 1827 this same prophet, resurrected, delivered the record to Joseph Smith, who by the power of God translated it. In it is a promise that any man who will read the book with a contrite heart and desire to know the truth will receive a witness that it is true. (See Moro. 10:4–5.) This book is called the Book of Mormon. It could not have been written by a man without divine help. It is an abridgment of more than a thousand years of records kept, yet it rings true. No person mentioned in the book is out of place or out of character. The Lord stands forth as sharp and vivid as in Palestine, and he completed his witness when the translation was published in 1830, a witness begun two thousand years before Christ. Anyone reading this book, the Book of Mormon, with a desire to know, and who will ponder as he reads and then ask the Lord if it be true, will know that it is a true account. He will know too that this Church is Christ’s Church and he will know that Joseph Smith was a prophet, a true prophet of the Lord Jesus Christ and his Father, the living God. Jesus Christ is the God of this earth, and he has carried its destiny in his hands from the beginning and will continue to do so until he gives the work complete to his Father, who is our Father in heaven.\nAnyone who will do these things will also know that President Harold B. Lee is a prophet of God. I add my witness to that of the others, that I know he is as I know the others have been, and I know that God will see that this work goes on to its end as he plans it, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "There is a section in old Boston town where the gas lanterns still adorn the streets to remind us of a bygone era of “the old lamplighter”—a profession that has become obsolete with the modern age. But the service of bringing light to a troubled world must never end.\nLet us examine some histories of those who were not afraid to be lamplighters and give of their light for the benefit of mankind.\nThe first few pages of the record an exciting story of a family living in an environment where wickedness abounded to such an extent the Lord sent his prophets to warn the people they must repent or face destruction. Troubled with this admonition, the father inquires of the Lord concerning the course he should follow to safeguard his family from the prophesied destruction. He was instructed to take his family and leave the city. The scriptures record: “And it came to pass that he departed into the wilderness. And he left his house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and his precious things, and took nothing with him, save it were his family, and provisions, and tents. …” (1 Ne. 2:4.)\nSo they were instructed to leave with just the bare essentials of food, clothing, and a tent for shelter. All of the other worldly accumulations were considered nonessentials and were to be left behind; that is, save one. For they had not traveled a great distance when the Lord reminded them that they had left one essential behind and were not to proceed until they had acquired it. It is interesting to note what the Lord considered that essential to be. He instructed them to return for the record of their people and also the genealogy of their forefathers. This was not an easy assignment. They had been asked to return to an unfriendly city to ask for a favor. The father made the request of his sons to undertake this dangerous assignment. The two older sons murmured at such a difficult task but Nephi recognized it to be inspired of the Lord and makes this declaration: “… I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.” (1 Ne. 3:7.)\nTheir first approach on this dangerous mission was to reason with Laban, the keeper of the record. This brought the response from him, “… Behold thou art a robber, and I will slay thee …” (1 Ne. 3:13), and they were forced to flee for their lives. The second approach was to go to their former home and gather up all of the riches they had left behind in an attempt to purchase the record. This approach also failed, for Laban recognized that he could have both. He took their riches from them and drove them away. After much internal strife and contention, Nephi decides to put his complete trust in the Lord and under the cover of night, seeks after the record. Laban is delivered into his hands in a drunken state and the Lord teaches Nephi a great lesson about the value of history. He declared to him that, “… It is better that one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief.” (1 Ne. 4:13.) Frightening results occur if a nation does not preserve and safeguard its sacred history. Nephi must have then realized that this sacred history would serve as a lamp to give light and direction to future generations. Certainly he was a lamplighter and willing to carry the torch to establish a new nation.\nThere comes a time when commemorations and anniversaries of historical events give us special significance and highlight the great heritage which has been given to us. In 1976, the United States of America will celebrate its 200th birthday—a time to pause and reflect on that which has been bestowed on us.\nI marvel at the faith and courage of our early leaders. Among them were many lamplighters who carried the torch of freedom. Ben Franklin was one of them. He was born in Boston in 1706, the fifteenth child and the youngest son in a family of 17. His parents were hard-working and God-fearing folk. His father made soap and candles in a shop at the sign of the blue ball on Milk Street. Ben was permitted to attend school for only two years, but he made the most of that short school experience. At the age of ten, he was put to work in his father’s shop helping to make candles. After two years of making candles he became restless and wanted to try something else. His older brother gave him the opportunity of learning the printing trade. His brother was a good teacher and Ben was a good student. But he was not content to be just a printer. He started to write under an assumed name of “Silence Dogood.” He would write an article and slip it under the door of the print shop at night. His brother would find it the following morning and was so impressed with many of the articles that he published them, until he found his younger brother was the author, and that was the end of “Silence Dogood.” At 17, Ben left home and moved to Philadelphia where he soon had a job with a printing firm. At the age of 24, he owned his own newspaper which soon became one of the most noted in the colonies.\nFranklin had a simple formula for business success. He believed that a successful man had to work a little harder than his competitors. Ben Franklin never actually sought public office, although he had a keen interest in public affairs which led him to civic service. When he found the postal service to be poor, he made several suggestions which led to his appointment as postmaster. He established the first subscription library. When fire losses were high, he reorganized the fire department. He reformed the city police when he found that criminals were getting away without punishment. The people of Philadelphia shamefully neglected the sick and the insane in Franklin’s time. He raised money to build a city hospital, the Pennsylvania Hospital for the unfortunates. Scientists in this city were not organized, so Franklin set up the first American Philosophical Society to bring them together. The city had no school for higher education, so he helped them form an academy which later grew into the University of Pennsylvania. As a result of these and other projects, Philadelphia became the most advanced city in the 13 colonies and Pennsylvania was one of the leading colonies. What happened to the 13 colonies literally affected free people throughout the world. One man touched a city, a city touched a state, a state touched a nation, and a nation touched the world. This was the man who said he would like to come back in 200 years to see if Americans still valued their freedom. I wonder what his reaction would be if he were granted that privilege. I believe his scientific mind would be excited with our growth and progress. But I believe that his civic pride would be wounded and hurt if he witnessed how content we are to fill the role of spectator rather than player on the field, making our contribution to the betterment of mankind.\nI am certain, however, Ben Franklin’s hurt feelings would not last long. He would see the opportunities around him in the world today, and off would come his coat, up would go his sleeves, and he would be at the job of creating something better. Here is a lamplighter who set an example for us to follow.\nThere is a familiar hymn I would like to have you adopt as a theme song for the next three years as we prepare for our year of celebration. I would like to have you sing it each morning as you arise to lift the hearts and spirits of your family. Whistle it as you go down the street on your way to work to remind you that the path you take will be a cleaner, happier place because you passed that way. Hum it in your shops or offices to encourage all around you to make a greater contribution. Meditate on it as you retire and kneel in prayer of thanksgiving for the opportunities you have had that day to make the world a better place.\n\n“Have I done any good in the world today?\nHave I helped any one in need?\nHave I cheered up the sad, and made someone feel glad?\nIf not, I have failed indeed.\nHas any one’s burden been lighter today,\nBecause I was willing to share?\nHave the sick and the weary been helped on their way?\nWhen they needed my help was I there?\nThen wake up, and do something more\nThan dream of your mansion above:\nDoing good is a pleasure, a joy beyond measure,\nA blessing of duty and love.”\n\n— no. 58.\n\nLet us sound the call today to revive the old profession of lamplighters. Let us each pick up our torch and illuminate the sacred histories, the eternal truths that divine providence has bestowed on us. Let us have the faith and courage of Nephi, roll up our sleeves like Ben Franklin, and “go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded.” May we be prepared and ready to celebrate with pride and thanksgiving our 200th anniversary with the comforting knowledge that we have made a worthy contribution to safeguard and protect those divinely inspired principles upon which this nation was established. I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "year": 1973,
        "content": "In the short period of time I stand at this pulpit, I would like to testify to you of my knowledge of the truthfulness of the doctrines and teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nWe live in what is described as the period of most enlightenment since the creation of the world. Scientific achievements of today are staggering to the human mind. We realize that the law under which these achievements have been accomplished has always been in existence, but it was not until this era that man’s learning and understanding have sufficiently increased to make use of natural laws to produce the accomplishments of today’s world.\nA few generations ago, goods were produced with hand tools from crude materials; but in our day, mass production has replaced the old methods with greater efficiency and better quality because of the genius and skills of man and the machines he has developed.\nAgriculture is the means of livelihood for more than half of the world’s population. As we pass through modernized farming areas, we no longer see farmers tilling the land with horse and plow, cutting one furrow at a time, or families working together in the fields at harvest time. These things seem to have disappeared. Today large pieces of mechanical equipment with the strength of a hundred horses plow many furrows at one time. Not many years ago the hand sickle was used to harvest the fields of ripened grain. The sheaves were flailed by hand and tossed into the wind to separate the chaff. Large combines now do all of the work in one operation as they mow the fields.\nHappenings in faraway places are viewed in the quiet of our own homes, a phenomenon which would have been considered a miracle in the generations preceding ours. Modern living requires that we have instantaneous communications at our side so that we may quickly dial and transact business or have the luxury of visiting, regardless of long intervening distances. Animals provided man’s transportation for centuries, but these have now been replaced by vehicles of great speed and comfort. There has always been a curiosity as to what lies beyond the river. Today’s rapid flight through the air has made the oceans no wider than the rivers of years past and man has quick access to the world.\nWe take great pride in modern accomplishments—the fact that we are better housed and fed, have greater conveniences, improved medical facilities, greater advantages in education, and the highest standard of living ever enjoyed in the history of the world.\nMany of my ancestors were engaged in the world’s most followed occupation of tilling the soil. Some of them left their old moorings in England and came to the shores of the New World, settling in the Plymouth and Massachusetts colonies. I get a warm feeling when I read the soul-stirring accounts of their conquest against hardship and the difficulties that faced them and their families.\nEarly missionaries of the Church went to Scotland, Denmark, and Norway, where other of my early ancestors lived. They accepted the teachings of the gospel, gave up the security of their homelands, and participated in the gathering to Zion. These people faced even greater hardships as they walked across the dusty plains of the Middle West and over the Rockies to the desert valleys of the mountains, pushing all of their earthly belongings in self-styled carts. The difficulties they endured bring tears to the eyes of those who are their beneficiaries today.\nThe stories of these people who have gone before us are ones of faith, devotion, and dedication. Although there were trials, hardships, and lack of the conveniences we think necessary in our world today, there seems to have been a happiness in their living, in their individual lives, and in their families. In their homes there was faith and prayer—faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and prayers to God asking for their needs and thanking him for his goodness to them. The Bible was read in the home and there was profound belief in its teachings. Life was more simple, but can we say that there was less happiness in simplicity?\nSociety has made a great effort to modernize the world in education, communication, travel, health, commerce, housing, and in many other ways, so as to increase the standard of living; but what has this socialization and modernization done to the family—the basic institution of society? Never before has there been greater instability. The divorce rate is higher now than at any time in history. Modernization has transferred the responsibility of education from the family to public institutions where modern thought has become paramount and moral principles have become abandoned. The crime rate has increased alarmingly. Drug addiction, disobedience to law, increase in venereal disease, and corruption in all forms seem to be accepted. In this day of modernization, freedom of thought and action is sponsored and promoted without consideration of the responsibilities that must accompany such freedoms if society is to be stabilized. Surely we would agree that the family institution has been seriously, if not irreparably, damaged in our society.\nIn the past, churches have taken a leading role in teaching men to have faith in God and to develop moral stability. What is happening to organized religion as a stabilizing force in society? Many of the largest of the Christian churches have reported losses in membership and also in income to carry on the work of their religious endeavors. Here again modernization has taken a heavy toll.\nModernism has become the order of the day in some religious thought. Modernists advocate a restatement of traditional doctrine on the grounds that today’s modern scholastic and scientific advances require a new critical interpretation of the Bible and the history of dogma. The term “modernism” is often used interchangeably with “liberalism.” Its advocates claim that religious truths are subject to constant reinterpretation in the light of modern knowledge; therefore, new and more advanced concepts are required to express modern thought and progress.\nThe Bible has been the subject of attack by modernists. It is said by some that science refuses to support the authenticity of such Biblical accounts as the creation of the world, placing life upon the earth, Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden, the flood, and many other happenings in the Old and New Testaments. What is claimed to be superior knowledge in this day of enlightenment causes some men to look upon these accounts as fables. Because of this, can believers in Christ repudiate them? In an attempt to regain the confidence of communicants who have ceased to believe, many liberal churches have abandoned one doctrine after another, even to the extent of failing to stand by the doctrine of the existence of a personal God. They no longer uphold as a reality the resurrection of the crucified Savior, and the doctrine of the atoning sacrifice has lost its credibility. Under such circumstances, how can organized religion maintain its place as a stabilizing influence in society?\nIn this day of increased knowledge, higher thought, and a modernization of the old, the simple has been overlooked and the profound sought after. The basic, simple, fundamental truths of the gospel are being ignored. Paul taught the true gospel of Jesus Christ to the people of Galatia and, after he left them, spurious teachers came and turned them from his teachings. This gave rise to the letter written by Paul in strong language of criticism, denouncing those who would pervert his teachings. He said to them:\n“I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.” (Gal. 1:6–8.)\nFrom the earliest days of the Christian church, spurious gospels have been taught—not really gospels, as Paul pointed out, for there is only one gospel of Christ. Today is not different. We are surrounded by frustrations and advances in thought and learning which raise questions and doubts. These seem to drag men down and destroy faith and morality. Where, then, is hope in this world of frustration and moral decay? It lies in the knowledge and understanding of the truths taught by the Master, which must be taught by the Church of Christ without deviation and believed in and lived by its membership. These are eternal truths and will be so in perpetuity regardless of changing circumstances in society, development of new scientific achievements, or increase of man’s knowledge.\nI believe we can be modern and enjoy the fruits of a modern world and its high standard of living, and I believe we can have the benefits of modern scholarship and scientific advances without turning to the theories of the modernist. I believe the principles of the gospel announced by the Savior in his personal ministry were true when they were given and are true today. Truth is eternal and never changing, and the gospel of Jesus Christ is ever contemporary in a changing world.\nThe knowledge explosion of which the world is so proud is not of man’s creation. It is his discovery of portions of the unlimited knowledge and information which is part of God’s knowledge. How we use it is determined by whether we are of the eternal kingdom of God or a part of the temporary understanding of the world. The question is simply this: are we seeking to find our place in the world in the realm of worldly thought, or are we seeking to find our place in the unchanging kingdom of God?\nHow grateful I am for my membership and association in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which takes an undeviating course in the world of change, believing in being modern, of course, but not subjecting the doctrines and truths announced by the Savior to reexamination and alteration to express “so-called” modern thought and modern progress. We take no such course.\nContrary to the views of many modernists, I know that God our Eternal Father lives; that the Bible is inspired and the Book of Mormon is also an inspired writing; that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is real and also lives, having shed his blood for us, and is truly and literally resurrected. I also bear witness that there is a prophet of God on the earth today.\nMay the Lord bless us in our righteous endeavors to shun the influences that lead into the ways of the world, that we may take our place, in faith and believing, in the kingdom of God, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, in the privilege of attending this great conference with you. I thank the Lord that in the establishment of his latter-day kingdom, he made provision for these conferences where we can come together and be fed the bread of life eternal, and in the words of the song:\n\nCome, listen to a prophet’s voice,\nAnd hear the word of God,\nAnd in the way of truth rejoice,\nAnd sing for joy aloud.\n\n— no. 46\n\nWe have been listening to the prophet’s voice in this conference. We will go back to our fields of labor strengthened in our faith and with a greater desire to help build his kingdom, and prepare the way for the coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\nThe prophet Isaiah saw our day when men would worship Him through the precepts of men, and said because of that He would “proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.” (Isa. 29:14.) Now I take it that that marvelous work and a wonder was to correct the precepts of men, because Isaiah indicated that it was for that reason that He would do a marvelous work and a wonder.\nThere isn’t time to discuss all of the wonderful corrections that have come through the restoration of the gospel, this marvelous work and a wonder. However, the first and great correction, I think, was the knowledge that came through the vision of the Father and the Son to the Prophet Joseph Smith, that President Marion G. Romney so beautifully described this morning. Instead of being a God which is an essence everywhere present, without body, parts, or passions (and this means he has no eyes, he cannot see; no ears, he cannot hear; no voice, he cannot speak), they were two glorified beings, as we will be following the resurrection. What a marvelous thing to have this commitment and to know that we are his children—the children of God the Eternal Father—and that we will be able to live in his presence and know who he is, and his Son Jesus Christ, who arose from the dead, and who atoned for the sins of the world.\nThe next great correction, I think, came in the great organization of the Church. Just think of the priesthood in this Church, and all of the auxiliary organizations, reference to which has been made here in this meeting as we have sustained the directing officers thereof. President Lee pointed out that the priesthood meeting tonight would be broadcast in 850 different buildings.\nWhere in all the world can you find an organization of priesthood like that, for every man and every man’s son can bear the priesthood of God and help to build his kingdom in the earth? Thus they lay away treasures in heaven, where moth and rust doth not corrupt and where thieves cannot break through and steal (see Matt. 6:19), and where they can develop their gifts and talents, because the kingdom is here for that very express purpose.\nNow there is another beautiful tenet of the Church today that I would like to mention a few words about, and that is our belief in the eternal duration of the marriage covenant and the family unit. It seems incredible that, as plainly as that principle is taught in the holy scriptures, we should be the only church that so believes. Here a few years ago, one of our brethren wrote a book called (Rulon S. Howells, Deseret Book Co., 1932.) In that book he had a chart prepared showing various doctrinal principles. He had inquired and obtained first-hand comments from the major churches (ten of them, including our own church) and there wasn’t one of those other nine churches that believed in the eternal duration of the marriage covenant and the family unit. They indicated that marriage was “until death do you part,” which in substance is a bill of divorcement. If it is to last only until death parts us, then what are we going to do from that time on? Where are the ties that bind us together, particularly in this church where we brethren work in the priesthood all the time, leaving our wives to raise our families for us, and all of that just to be parted when death comes along?\nI spoke in a meeting down in Quitman, Georgia, when I was president of the mission down there, and I quoted the statement that I have referred to from the chart prepared in this book, and at the close of the meeting I stood at the door to greet the people as they left. A man came up and introduced himself to me as a Baptist minister, and I said: “Did I misquote you here tonight?”\n“No, Mr. Richards,” he said. “It is just like you say. We don’t all believe all the things our churches teach.”\nI said, “You don’t believe them either. Why don’t you go back and teach your people the truth? They will take it from you, and they are not ready to take it from the Mormon elders yet.”\nHe said, “I will see you again.”\nThe next time I went there, about four months later, as I walked up to that little church, there stood that Baptist minister. As we shook hands I said, “I would certainly be interested to know what you thought of my last sermon here.” He said, “Mr. Richards, I have been thinking about it ever since. I believe every word you said, only I would like to have heard the rest of it.” You know we never get talked out when we start talking about these beautiful principles that the Lord has given us through the restoration of the gospel, through the bringing forth of this marvelous work and a wonder.\nWhile I was president of the mission in Atlanta, Georgia, I went to the study of Dr. Peter Marshall. He was the pastor of the Presbyterian Church there and we spent an hour or two together. When he died he was the chaplain of the United States Senate. You may have read his book, or may have seen the movie depicting his life. Many of the things he stood for he learned from us down in Atlanta. He used to send over to the mission office to get the MIA books and other Church material for his young people because he felt we were stealing them all away from him.\nAs I sat in his study with him, I asked him what was the attitude of his church with respect to the principle of eternal marriage, and the eternal duration of the marriage covenant. He said, “Well, Mr. Richards, we are not allowed to teach that in our church, but in my mind I have some stubborn objections.” He went on, “When you take the kitten away from the cat, in a few days the cat has forgotten all about the kitten; when you take a calf away from the cow, in a few days the cow has forgotten all about the calf; but when you take the child away from its mother’s bosom, though she live to be a hundred years old, she never forgets the child of her bosom.” He added, “I find it difficult to believe that God created love like that to perish in the grave.” Thank God we know that he didn’t create love like that to perish in the grave. Love is eternal.\nNow while the other churches don’t teach that principle, there are some people who believe it. For instance, Anderson M. Baten said this in a little verse he wrote to his wife Beulah on the mysteries of life:\n\nI wed thee forever, not for now\nNot for the sham of earth’s brief years.\nI wed thee for the life beyond the tears,\nBeyond the heartache and clouded brow.\nLove knows no grave, and it shall guide us, dear\nWhen life’s spent candles flutter and burn low.\n\nNow that is what we believe. We believe that the marriage tie is eternal.\n\nWe have had quoted in the conference today the statement made by the Lord when Adam was placed in the garden. He said that “it was not good that the man should be alone;” and he made a help meet for him, and he said “they shall be one flesh,” (Moses 3:18, 24), not two halves but one flesh, because he couldn’t have peopled this earth without the man and the woman, and it took two to make a complete person in that sense. Then I say this: if it wasn’t good for man to be alone before death came into the world, it certainly won’t be good for man to be alone after we are resurrected from the dead and restored to the condition that Adam was in before the fall.\nThat is what Paul meant when he said, “… as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.” (1 Cor. 15:22.) If it wasn’t good to be without a wife before the fall, it certainly won’t be good to be without a companion after the resurrection, and anyone who repudiates that actually repudiates the great atonement, because in that event the Savior would only have atoned in part for the loss that came through the fall of Adam and Eve.\nThese are great eternal truths that the Lord understood, and so the Savior said, “For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife; And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.” (Mark 10:7–9.) It couldn’t be written much plainer than that, could it? What did he really mean when he said that they should be one flesh and never be put asunder if it wasn’t that the marriage tie should project itself beyond the grave?\nPaul said, “… neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.” (1 Cor. 11:11.) They might get along here in mortality without each other, but not in the eternities that are to come.\nPeter said that the husband should live with his wife “according to knowledge, … as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.” (1 Pet. 3:7.) Now what does it mean “being heirs together of the grace of life”? What life? They already had their lives here in mortality, but they are to become heirs together of the blessings of eternal life. How could it be written any plainer than that?\nThen we remember when Isaiah saw the new heaven and the new earth, when the lamb and the wolf should feed together, and “the lion shall eat straw like the bullock. …” (Isa. 65:25.) He saw that men “shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.\n“They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: … and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands … for they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord, and their offspring with them.” (Isa. 65:21–23.) How could you make it any more plain than that, that they and their offspring with them would inhabit the houses that they would build?\nNow this great eternal principle is one of the great truths that has been revealed through the restoration of the gospel. Personally I would just as soon believe that death was a complete annihilation of both body and spirit as to think that I would have to live on forever and forever without a continuation of the love ties that bind my wife and me together, and our family and our loved ones here in this life. Heaven will only be a projection of our life here.\nThat helps us to understand the statement and the counsel and the advice of President [David O.] McKay when he said that no success in life can compensate for failure in the home. President Lee has emphasized the same thing by saying that our greatest responsibility is within the walls of our own home, not just because those homes should be good until death parts us, but because we are building a foundation of a kingdom over which we will be privileged to preside throughout the eternities that are to come, if we are true and faithful. And that is one of the glorious principles of the gospel that has come through the restoration here in our day and in our time.\nWe have read in the papers in time past where children have been kidnapped, and their parents in some cases have offered hundreds of thousands of dollars to get them back just so they could enjoy them during this period of mortality. Yet through the new and everlasting covenant and the sealing ordinances of the holy priesthood in God’s holy temples, we can have our children throughout the countless ages of eternity. The Lord has indicated through the Prophet Joseph that they should come forth in the morning of the first resurrection and “grow up without sin unto salvation.” (D&C 45:58.) To those of us who have laid away children in their infancy, just think of the joy and happiness that comes from this, compared with feeling that there would be no family relationship in the eternal world.\nBrethren and sisters, I thank God for this great truth that has come to us in the restoration of his gospel. That is only just a beginning. And to this great audience here today, and all that are listening in over the radio and those who will listen in tonight, and those in whose hearts God has planted a witness and a testimony of the divinity of this work, I bear you my witness. I know that it is the marvelous work and a wonder that our Father promised through his great prophet that he would send to us, and I leave you my love and blessing and witness, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "In the greatest sermon that was ever preached, the greatest man who ever lived gave what was probably the wisest counsel that has ever been given when he said that we should lay up for ourselves treasures in heaven. And that is probably our most profitable idea.\nHowever, the thing that we spend more time doing than about anything else in our lives is laying up for ourselves treasures upon the earth. And that is also a great idea, providing we know how to handle it. Many people have contended for the treasures in heaven on the grounds that they have much greater value, they are a lot more satisfying, they are a lot more permanent. Someone has complained that one of the disadvantages of the treasures of the earth is that you can’t take them with you. Someone else has pointed out that with taxes like they are, you can’t even keep them while you are here. This man put this idea in rhyme. He said:\n\n“You can’t take them with you,\nThat’s practically sure;\nFor they’re generally gone,\nQuite a long time before you’re.”\n\nNow that may not be very good poetry, but it is a striking idea. And some pessimist has added that even if you could take them with you, they would only melt. However, it seems to me that frequently we spend a lot more time than is necessary in downgrading these great treasures that we get from the earth. We sometimes refer to our medium of exchange by calling it such unsavory names as “filthy lucre” or “tainted money,” and sometimes that may be an accurate description, but it need not necessarily be so.\nSomebody said, “Money can’t buy happiness,” but his friend said, “Maybe not, but it does enable one to pick out the particular kind of misery that he enjoys the most.” And someone has pointed out that if there is anyone who can’t buy happiness with money it must be that he just doesn’t know where to shop. We can build temples with money, we can send out missionaries with money, we can erect educational institutions, operate hospitals, and pay our tithing with money. We can feed and clothe our families with money, and in many ways we can build up the kingdom of God with money.\nSomeone said, “Money ain’t everything,” and his friend said, “Just name me three things that it ain’t.” But we also should think of some of those things that it is. Money is preserved labor, it is industry made negotiable, it is stored up accomplishment. It is the medium of exchange that we can trade for things that we can take with us and a great many of them we can actually send on ahead. We can take our families with us. We can take our education with us. We can take our great character qualities with us. And money is the medium that we can use to share the treasures of the earth with others who need our help.\nIn 1931, Vashni [H.P.] Young wrote a popular best-seller entitled (Bobbs-Merrill). Vashni Young had worked as a salesman during the lush, easy, prosperous years of the late 1920s, and then the market crash of October 1929 had plunged Vashni Young, with a few million other people, into the bottomless economic pit of the early 1930s. But he did not like the depression and he had become pretty sour on this world generally. And so he bought a gun and decided to have a look at the next world by committing suicide. But before he pulled the trigger, he spent a little time thinking about his wife and children and he decided that suicide was not a very manly way to solve a problem. And so instead of shooting himself, he did a little analyzing and he discovered that his mind had been operating like a giant junk factory, turning out all kinds of mental, emotional, and spiritual junk.\nThen he remembered William James, the great Harvard psychologist who said, “The greatest discovery of my generation is that you can change your circumstances by changing your attitudes of mind.” And while everybody wants to change his circumstances, Vash Young decided to change himself. He said: “I got tired of being a fool.” He wanted to get out of the junk business and so he dumped overboard a lot of his bad habits of liquor, tobacco, and irresponsibility. He decided to adopt some good attitudes, think like a man, be responsible, and go to work.\nIt wasn’t long before Vash Young discovered that life was much more pleasant and that his prosperity level was going up by leaps and bounds. And then he made a great discovery that he had personal possession of a vast fortune which he could share with every other person in the world without lessening his own supply.\nHe wrote his great book, and gave it as wide a circulation as possible, telling people about his discovery. Then he set aside one day each week which he called “trouble day” during which he worked with other troubled people trying to persuade them to get out of the junk business and share in this great fortune which was so readily available.\nIf I were asked to give the best idea of which I am capable, it would be closely related to this, that we should get out of the junk business and then start laying up treasures in heaven by sharing with others that vast fortune which each of us has or can get possession of.\nYesterday President Rex D. Pinegar mentioned Patrick Henry, one of our early American patriots who lived a long, useful, and successful life. Just before his death he said, “I have now finished distributing all of my property to my children. However, there is one more thing that I wish I could give them, and that is the Christian religion. If I could give them that, though I had not given them a single shilling, they would be rich. And if they did not have that, though I had given them the whole world, they would be poor.”\nI hold in my hand a copy of the Holy Bible. In this is written the word of the Lord. It contains the covenants that he has made and would like to make with every person who has lived or who ever will live upon the earth. This book gives an account of one occasion some 34 centuries ago when the God of creation came down on to the top of Mt. Sinai in a cloud of fire, and to the accompaniment of the lightnings and thunders of that sacred mountain gave us the Ten Commandments, in which he enumerated ten ways that we can get out of the junk business. Just think what would happen in our world if we all fully observed the Ten Commandments. That would mean that we would stop cheating and lying and stealing and killing and being immoral and violating the Sabbath day. Then this earth would soon be God’s paradise and our material prosperity would go up like a skyrocket. The Lord has also included in the Bible a great credenda of those soul-saving truths that we can share with other people. The Bible is the Lord’s own fortune-to-share book.\nAs Sir Walter Scott lay dying, he said to his son-in-law, “Lockhart, read to me from the book.” His son-in-law said, “Which book?” Sir Walter said, “Lockhart, there is only one book. Read to me from the book.”\nBut in our own day, the Lord has given to the world three great volumes of new scripture outlining in every detail the simple principles of the gospel of Christ, with a “thus saith the Lord” attached to each one. Therefore, the Lord now has four fortune-to-share books.\nHowever, one of the shortcomings of even the holy scriptures is that they are not automatic. That is, they will not work unless we do. More than anything else the great message of the Lord needs messengers. The Lord has invited us to have as large a share as we like in his important family concern which Jesus referred to as “my Father’s business.” Now that is the business of building integrity and character and righteousness and eternal life into the lives of his children. The Lord has told us many things about the importance of the family. He has given us this miraculous power of procreation where we can create children in God’s own image and share with them the tremendous blessings of life itself. Then during our family home evenings we may share with them the great treasures of the gospel of salvation. And through the missionary program we can share the blessings of eternal life with all of our friends and neighbors. God has promised us that if we will effectively be his messengers he will share his fortune with both those who give it and those who receive it.\nIn speaking of the oath and covenant of the priesthood, he has said:\n“For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me;\n“And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father;\n“And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father’s kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him.” (D&C 84:36–38.) If you can think of something more exciting than that, I don’t know what it would be.\nGod is a very wealthy personage. We all like to inherit from a wealthy parent and what could be more exciting than to inherit from God, to get everything that God has. Someone has said that thrift is a great virtue, especially in an ancestor. And God has been very thrifty, he has also been very wise and he has been very generous. To begin with, he created us in his own image and has endowed us with a set of his attributes and potentialities, the development of which is one of the purposes for which we live. He desires that every one of us should be rich. He has said: “… the fulness of the earth is yours …” (D&C 59:16), and it pleaseth God that he has given all these things unto men to be used with judgment and thanksgiving. He has shared with us the fulness of the treasures of the earth and he desires to share with us the fulness of the treasures of heaven. He wants us to inherit the celestial kingdom and belong to that celestial order of which he himself is a member. And he has said that the greatest of all the gifts of God is the gift of eternal life in his presence.\nAnd so we come back to the place where we began and hear again those great words as they come down to us from the mount in which the Lord of Hosts has said, “… lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven. …” (Matt. 6:20.)\nAnd that we may be fully successful in this greatest of all enterprises, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "In the heavens, before the earth was formed, the plan of this earth life was explained to all of us. We were then but spirit offspring of our Father and Mother in heaven.\nWe all learned then that through this earth life experience we would have the opportunity of going through the same type of experiences they had done and so become as they are.\nThe records tell us that we all shouted for joy at this glorious news.\nWe also learned that to attain such lofty goals, we would have to be found true and faithful in all things and withstand the trials and tests which would be put upon us by Satan. In spite of all the warnings, I’m sure we were still anxious to come to this earth.\nAdam and Eve were the first to come. They were given their free agency without the capacity of knowing right from wrong until after they had partaken of the fruit of “the tree of knowledge of good and evil. …” (Moses 3:17.)\nIn consequence thereof, the Lord declared to Adam: “… cursed shall be the ground for thy sake. …” (Moses 4:23; italics added.) We often hear it said that Adam was cursed because he partook of the forbidden fruit. The record says “the ground” was cursed, not Adam. Then the Lord added “for thy sake.” This means for his benefit; also for your benefit and mine.\nAdam and Eve had been in a state of stagnation: no progress—no growth—no reproduction. Without a change, they would have remained in that state forever. It was necessary for a change to take place. This change meant that Adam and all his posterity would have to work and overcome obstacles to provide the necessities of life.\nAfter Adam and Eve were driven out of the Garden of Eden, an angel of the Lord came and explained to them the gospel plan. He explained the plan of life and salvation. He told them of a Savior who would come and redeem all mankind so that all could return to our Father in heaven.\nIn the Book of Moses we read: “And Eve, his wife, heard all these things and was glad, saying: Were it not for our transgression we never should have had seed, and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient.” (Moses 5:11.)\nModern revelation tells us: “… it must needs be that the devil should tempt the children of men, or they could not be agents unto themselves; for if they never should have bitter they could not know the sweet.” (D&C 29:39.)\nSo it is with us today, we must also have the bitter in order to know the sweet. Sometimes some of us think we have the bitter and not enough of the sweet. This is normal. We all have our trials of life to strengthen us. Each thinks he has the hardest or most severe trials. It may be that they are the most difficult only because they are the hardest or most difficult for you. The diamond is enhanced and made more valuable with polishing. Steel is made harder and more valuable through tempering. So also opposition builds the character of man.\nAll progress is made by overcoming an opposing force. Lehi said to his son Jacob: “For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. …” (2 Ne. 2:11.)\n“Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.” (2 Ne. 2:25.)\n“God … shall consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain.” (2 Ne. 2:2.)\nOpposition, then, is good for us as long as we don’t seek it for opposition’s sake.\nThis reminds me of one of President Lee’s favorite sayings: “It’s all right to pull the cow out of the mud on Sunday, provided that you don’t push him in on Saturday night.”\nHenry Kaiser, of the steel industry, said that if you want to find who your leaders are, load them up with work, pour it on. You’ll then find who the leaders are.\nIt may be that’s just what the Lord does with us. He too is trying to develop leaders.\nI remember a brass plaque I had on the wall in my room when I was much younger. It depicted a tramp going over the top of a fence. A piece out of the seat of his pants was missing. A bulldog was in close pursuit with the missing piece of pants in his teeth. The verse read:\n\n“’Tis easy enough to be pleasant\nWhen life goes by with a song,\nBut the man worthwhile\nIs the man who can smile\nWhen everything goes dead wrong.”\n\nGod would be very unjust if he were to turn Lucifer loose to tempt man without giving him help to overcome. God will not permit Satan to have power over you, to tempt you beyond the strength He will give you if you will seek and accept His help.\nIn the beginning, an angel of the Lord taught Adam and Eve. He instructed them in all things so they would know the will of the Lord.\nI think it is the same today. We must study the scriptures, learn what God’s plan is for us. We must learn the consequences of obedience and disobedience. He has provided prophets and teachers in each dispensation to teach us God’s will concerning us. He has provided us with scriptures—the Bible, the Book of Mormon, and modern-day revelations. He has restored the gospel with the fulness of the priesthood. He has given us the Holy Ghost to reveal to us the will of the Father and the Son and to enlighten us in all truth. He has given us temples and the keys to officiate in the ordinances thereof.\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith has said: “God shall give unto you knowledge by his Holy Spirit, yea, by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost, that has not been revealed since the world was until now;\n“Which our forefathers have awaited with anxious expectation to be revealed in the last times, which their minds were pointed to by the angels, as held in reserve for the fulness of their glory.” (D&C 121:26–27.)\nThis means that even our forefathers came ahead of us for our benefit, with a promise we would render a service to them.\nYes, the Lord will help us, if we do our part. We must do something more than just resist Satan. We must render service to our fellowmen. Are you doing your part?\nGod has said: “For behold, this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.” (Moses 1:39.)\nRemember that this world was created and all the development and the progress on this earth from Adam till now have been primarily for you as much as anyone else.\nChrist came to atone for you.\nThe gospel was restored for you.\nThe Lord will answer your prayers.\nGod is mindful of you, for you are a son or daughter of God.\nIt is true—each has a different life to live and a different task to fill. Some tasks may be more important than others, but you—a son or daughter of God—are just as important to God as anyone else.\nI think the song written by William Clayton is as important for our encouragement today as it was to the pioneers.\n\n“Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear;\nBut with joy wend your way.\nThough hard to you this journey may appear,\nGrace shall be as your day.\n’Tis better far for us to strive\nOur useless cares from us to drive;\nDo this, and joy your hearts will swell—\nAll is well! All is well!\n\n“Why should we mourn or think our lot is hard?\n’Tis not so, all is right.\nWhy should we think to earn a great reward,\nIf we now shun the fight?\nGird up your loins; fresh courage take;\nOur God will never us forsake;\nAnd soon we’ll have this tale to tell—\nAll is well! All is well!”\n\n— no. 13.\n\nMay the Lord bless each one of you to accomplish your goal in life, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "month": "10",
        "year": 1973,
        "content": "At one of the stake conferences to which I was assigned, a home teacher was invited to be a speaker at the general session on Sunday morning. He began by telling about a man who accidentally fell into the waters of the Niagara River some distance above the falls. As he was carried downstream by the current, he called out repeatedly, “Which way to shore? Which way to shore?” There were people along the banks on both sides of the river who saw and heard this man but they were slow to act. They noticed that he could swim and was keeping himself afloat, so they concluded that he was engaged in some kind of a publicity stunt and gave him no further attention. However, when he reached the point where he was precariously close to the falls some of the people along the banks went into action and tried to get ropes to him to pull him from the water. But they had waited too long and he went over the brink of the falls and was killed. When his body was recovered and identification made, the horizons of those along the banks of the river were pushed back and their understandings improved and increased. Yes, the man could swim, but he could not swim with purpose or direction because he was blind.\nThat illustration used by a home teacher to motivate the members of his stake to become more actively engaged in discharging their responsibilities in doing missionary work with their nonmember friends and neighbors had a missionary thrust; but I found many other messages there also. There are many people in the world today who are in distress, and who, in their hearts, are calling out, “Which way to shore?” All too often those of us who are around them do not even hear them, or if we do, we do not respond because we allow ourselves to become so busy doing this, that, or the other, that we are not tuned in properly, or perhaps it is because we just don’t want to get involved.\nLet me say, my brothers and sisters, that if we want to save individuals, to save the souls of our Father’s children, we must be willing to get involved and to help others get involved in meaningful ways also.\nSome of those who are calling out for help are the honest in heart who are earnestly seeking the truth, but they do not know where to find it. They fit into the category referred to in the Doctrine and Covenants, Section 123, verse 12, which reads as follows:\n“For there are many yet on the earth among all sects, parties, and denominations, who are blinded by the subtle craftiness of men, whereby they lie in wait to deceive, and who are only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it.”\nMy brothers and sisters, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has the truth, the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, restored to the earth in these the last days through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Furthermore, this Church has received a charge from the Lord to proclaim the restored gospel message to all the world. Obedient to that charge the Church is carrying out a vigorous missionary program in many countries of the world. In addition, the members of the Church everywhere have been challenged to do missionary work with their nonmember friends and neighbors, and to do a better job of living the gospel, so that their lives are shining examples of the gospel of Jesus Christ in action. This will open the doors of the honest in heart and the teaching of the precepts can then be done most effectively.\nWe say to the honest in heart everywhere: Listen to our message; give it prayerful, careful consideration, and then seek a witness from on high through the power of the Holy Ghost that our message is true. There is just too much at stake to do otherwise. We make some strong claims in our Church; we do not apologize for that. We have that responsibility. We have the truth. We are proclaiming the truth. Give it careful, prayerful consideration.\nSome of those who are calling out for help are confused and disturbed by this complex, somewhat contradictory world in which we live, a world that has many crosswinds and crosscurrents, and even some eddies and whirlpools that can entrap and destroy. Let us remember that. Many of these people are yearning for the inner peace and joy that really can come only through love of God and love of fellowmen and from keeping God’s commandments. We have been promised in Deuteronomy, in chapter 4, verse 29, that if we seek the Lord diligently we shall surely find him, and these are the words:\n“But if from thence thou shalt seek the Lord thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.”\nRemember that, you, the honest in heart, wherever you may be and listen to our message.\nIn some cases those who are seeking help are young people who are the products of broken homes or who have been raised under conditions where force has been used instead of love and where there is contention and strife and bickering and quarreling, instead of unity and harmony. It has been my privilege to work with young people all my life, and I know that ofttimes young people who are raised under such conditions frequently lack purpose and direction in their living.\nSome who need help are in bondage to sin and seemingly cannot break those bonds without help from others. Many of them are crying out in their hearts for assistance. Some of them haven’t yet reached the stage where they have truly repented, and they need assistance in that, too. Others are having difficulty reconciling science and religion, perhaps because they have pulled the horizons in too close, and haven’t brought into the picture all they should bring into the picture in order to see relationships clearly, to interpret correctly, and draw sound conclusions; and perhaps because they have used man’s measuring sticks instead of God’s measuring sticks.\nSome who need help are disillusioned because they have been taken advantage of by dishonest individuals. Then there are those who do not have loved ones or friends, and who are lonely and discouraged, and need the hand of fellowship extended to them.\nMy brothers and sisters, how fortunate we are to have the gospel of Jesus Christ in its fulness, and the marvelous programs of this Church, and a living prophet, a true prophet of God to guide us and direct us in these troubled times. I say to you, my brothers and sisters, that the gospel of Jesus Christ is the way to shore and to safety, to happiness in this life and to eternal life and eternal joy in the life to come. It can light the way for all who will open their eyes, their ears, and their hearts. But it isn’t enough for us to just look and listen. We must listen and apply. We must act. This has been stated very effectively by the poet, Longfellow, in his poem, “Psalm of Life,” which is one of my favorites. I should like to repeat part of that at this time:\n\nTrust no Future, howe’er pleasant!\nLet the dead Past bury its dead!\nAct, act in the living Present!\nHeart within, and God o’erhead!\n\nLives of great men all remind us\nWe can make our lives sublime,\nAnd, departing, leave behind us\nFootprints on the sands of time.\n\nFootprints, that perhaps another,\nSailing o’er life’s solemn main,\nA forlorn and shipwrecked brother,\nSeeing, shall take heart again.\n\nLet us then be up and doing,\nWith a heart for any fate;\nStill achieving, still pursuing,\nLearn to labor and to wait.\n\nLet us remind ourselves, my brothers and sisters, that the gospel of Jesus Christ is to be lived, not just read about or talked about or thought about. It is to be lived. That is when it takes on its great power in the lives of men and women, and in building the kingdom of God. As we learn to do that, my brothers and sisters, we are blessed, for the Lord has said, “I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise.” (D&C 82:10.)\nAs we are able to perfect our lives, the blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ become more and more meaningful, and we experience that inner joy and peace for which there is no substitute.\nNow we all know we do not have to obey the laws of God or keep the commandments because we have our free agency, but I should like to emphasize that none of us have our free agency to determine the consequences of the choices we make, because laws operate, and along with the exercising of our free agency, we become accountable and responsible for our acts.\nThe scriptures are replete with examples of what happens when people do not heed the words of the prophets and do not keep the commandments. Let your minds recall what happened to the wicked when the flood came in the days of Noah, of what happened when Jerusalem was destroyed, and what happened to the Jaredites and the Nephites in Book of Mormon days because they did not keep the commandments and did not listen to the voices of the prophets.\nI think we should also remember that the scriptures, and even the pages of secular history, are replete with examples of what can happen when people do keep the commandments of God. Those great blessings have been referred to in various ways during this conference.\nReference was made, I believe, in the welfare meeting this morning to Enoch and the righteousness of the people who were associated with him. Let me just read verse 67 from chapter 7 of Moses in the Pearl of Great Price:\n“And the Lord showed Enoch all things, even unto the end of the world; and he saw the day of the righteous, the hour of their redemption; and received a fulness of joy.”\nThere are many other things that could be said, but let me just summarize some of the things that have already been said pertaining to the great blessings that come through keeping the commandments and obeying the laws.\nPresident Lee in his opening message talked about self-respect. That is a great blessing we can get if we really keep the commandments and we won’t have self-respect unless we do. Other great blessings I should like to mention are: a clear conscience, inner peace, the companionship of the Holy Ghost to guide us and direct us, and the blessings promised to those who keep the Word of Wisdom.\nThe Word of Wisdom has had special meaning in my life because of my involvement in athletics, my interest in education, and the appreciation I have had for good health. Let us remind ourselves of the promises given in verses 18 to 21 of the 89th section of the Doctrine and Covenants:\n“And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones;\n“And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures;\n“And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.\n“And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them.”\nWhat great promises! My brothers and sisters, let me just end by emphasizing the great blessings of eternal happiness, eternal joy, and eternal life, and those are related of course; they are tied together. They cannot be separated.\nI leave you my testimony, my brothers and sisters, that the gospel of Jesus Christ is the way to shore, and to safety, and to happiness here and to joy eternally. I bear testimony that God does live, his Son Jesus Christ lives. The gospel of Jesus Christ is true, and we have a true and living prophet guiding us today, pointing the way under guidance and direction from on high in the troubled conditions under which we live. I leave you that testimony, my brothers and sisters, in all humility, and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "There is genuine concern over the diminishing role of the father in the home. His influence is fading. Presiding responsibilities formerly assumed are left either to the mother or to agencies outside the home. This diminishing role is at the root of a multitude of our problems. Numerous things go awry when the scriptural family organization is upset!\nThe father is the patriarch in the home. This means that the father is the presiding authority. This does not mean that he should be dictatorial. Modern scriptures set forth qualifications for all who preside:\n“No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned. …” (D&C 121:41.)\nIn reality, each family is a dominion within itself. Father heads that government. In the beginning it was the only government on the earth and was passed down from Adam to his descendants. Properly organized in the Church, the father is the patriarch of an eternal family unit. Heaven, to us, will be simply an extension of an ideal home. As the presiding priesthood officer, the father fills an irreplaceable role.\nA worthy father who holds the Melchizedek Priesthood should be encouraged to name and bless his children. He should administer to the sick in his home. The father may baptize, confirm, and ordain his children, at the invitation of his file leader in the Church. He may give a father’s blessing. President Joseph Fielding Smith has said:\n“A faithful father who holds the Melchizedek Priesthood may bless his own children, and that would be a patriarchal (father’s) blessing. Such blessing could be recorded in the family records, but it would not be preserved in the archives of the Church. … In addition, children may receive a blessing by an ordained patriarch. A father blessing his own child could, if he received the inspiration to do so, declare the lineage of the child. As the Patriarch of his home, a father is also a revelator to his family … and, … in this sense stands in line to receive the revelations from the Lord for the good and blessing of that family.” ( 3:172.)\nThe father exercises his spiritual leadership in the home by calling his family to prayer each morning and evening. Weekly family home evening, likewise, is called and presided over by the father, though all others participate.\nThe father is the protector of the home. He guards it against the intrusion of evil from without. Formerly he protected his home with weapons and shuttered windows. Today the task is more complex. Barred doors and windows protect only against the intrusion of a corporeal creature. It is not an easy thing to protect one’s family against intrusions of evil into the minds and spirits of family members. These influences can and do flow freely into the home. Satan can subtly beguile the children of men in ways we have already mentioned in this conference. He need not break down the door.\nFathers, you will have to live close to the Lord. Develop a sensitivity to the impressions of the Spirit.\nThere is yet another intrusion into the home that needs to be mentioned. It is an unwise father who carries to his family his daily business cares. They disturb the peace existing there. He should leave his worries at the office and enter his home with the spirit of peace in his heart and with the love of God burning within him. If there is friction, his presence should soothe it. If there is turmoil, he should resolve it.\nI have a friend, a businessman in this city, who does special ordinance work in the temple. One day I passed him on the street and asked where he was going. “I’m going to the temple. Inside those thick walls, in the quiet serenity of that lovely building,” he said, “I find peace.” Then he added, “There is only one other place in the world where I can find peace—in my own home.” What a compliment to his wife! What a compliment to his children! What a credit to him. This should be the ideal for all fathers—to so live that we can find peace in our homes.\nFathers, draw close to your children. Learn to communicate. Learn to listen. This means giving a father’s most valuable commodity—time! Only good results occur when a father interviews his sons and daughters regularly. He can know their problems and their hopes. He can align himself with them as their unconditional friend. To the extent we become friends with our children in unconditional love, to that extent we become like our Heavenly Father.\nThe story is told of an elementary teacher who had students write essays in hopes that it would motivate the fathers to attend a PTA meeting. The fathers came in $4,000 cars and $400 cars—bank president, laborer, clerk, salesman, meter reader, baker, etc.—“every man with a definite estimate of himself in terms of money, skill, and righteousness or looks. … The children’s essays were read at random.\n“‘I like my daddy, … he built my doll house, took me coasting, taught me to shoot, helps with my schoolwork, takes me to the park, gave me a pig to fatten and sell.’ Scores of the essays could be reduced in essence to: ‘I like my daddy. He plays with me.’\n“Not one child mentioned his family house, car, neighborhood, food, or clothing.\n“The fathers went into the meeting from many walks of life; they came out in two classes: companions to their children or strangers to their children.” (“The Savior, the Priesthood, and You,” Melchizedek Priesthood quorums’ course of study for 1973–74, p. 226.)\nGod help us to be real companions.\nA father is a teacher. The Lord has commanded sons and daughters to honor their parents and to give heed to their counsel. The words that open that great volume of scripture, the Book of Mormon, ought to be our guide as fathers: “… having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father.” (1 Ne. 1:1.)\nEnos, likewise, credited his father for his teachings: “… knowing my father that he was a just man—for he taught me in his language, and also the nurture and admonition of the Lord—and blessed be the name of my God for it. …” (Enos 1:1.)\nHave you fathers noticed that the present Melchizedek Priesthood lessons are like father-training lessons? I cite an example:\n“One father and son have an agreement that the son will be in at a specified time. Before the parents retire they set the alarm for that time with the understanding that the son is to turn the alarm off before it rings when he comes home. If it does go off, the son knows that his parents will be waiting for him and further, he will not have the privilege of going out for two weeks. Follow-through on the agreement between them is the key that creates better understanding.” (“The Savior, the Priesthood, and You,” Melchizedek Priesthood quorums’ course of study for 1973–74, p. 237.)\nSomeone has said: “There is no need of searching out your genealogy if you do not know where your children were last night.” Many inspiring suggestions enliven this practical course of study for fathers. I heartily commend this course to strengthen fathers for better spiritual leadership.\nDiscipline is part of the process of governing children. The Lord has told us how:\n“Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy.” (D&C 121:43.)\nThere has been no better statement of a father-child relationship. When a father wisely corrects his son, it proves his love. Only the unwise foolishly indulge their sons and withhold proper discipline.\nAnd finally, the father is to be an example of the highest Christian virtues. To walk uprightly in the admonition of the Lord requires not only patience and forbearance, but an exercise in constant practice of all the Christian virtues by each family member. Perhaps the Lord knew this when he instituted the family. A man needs the responsibility of a wife and family. He needs the responsibility of being an example of righteousness. There is wisdom in this requirement. This kind of gentle persuasion is needed to keep a father “on course” and gently guide him toward perfection.\nIn the family relationship, we find our best laboratory in which to practice celestial living. While this task is fraught with much challenge and some adversity, it is, nevertheless, blessed with that supreme joy that can come only to a father.\nIt should have great meaning that of all the titles of respect and honor and admiration that could be given him, that God himself, he who is the highest of all, chose to be addressed simply as “Father.”\nI am grateful indeed to see the emphasis given by the Church leaders today on the place and position of fathers. There has never been a time in the history of the Church when the importance and place of the Melchizedek Priesthood quorums have been emphasized more and where the activity of fathers has been stressed so much. I know that this is inspired direction by our leaders today.\nI know that God lives. I know that Jesus is the Christ. I know that he guides this Church through a living prophet on the earth today, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "My brethren and sisters, seen and unseen; we are all brothers and sisters, children of the same Father in the spirit. Humbly and gratefully I stand before you this afternoon. I have been on my knees, in fasting and prayer, as have members of my family, that I may have the blessing of the Spirit.\nMy text today is from a revelation of the Lord to Joseph Smith, the Prophet, at a conference of the Church January 2, 1831, as follows: “… if ye are prepared ye shall not fear.” (D&C 38:30.)\nIn section 1 of the great Doctrine and Covenants, a volume of modern scripture, we read these words: “Prepare ye, prepare ye for that which is to come. …” (D&C 1:12.) Further in this same revelation are these warning words: “… I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth . …” (D&C 1:17.)\nWhat are some of the calamities for which we are to prepare? In section 29 the Lord warns us of “a great hailstorm sent forth to destroy the crops of the earth.” (D&C 29:16.) In section 45 we read of “an overflowing scourge; for a desolating sickness shall cover the land.” (D&C 45:31.) In section 63 the Lord declares he has “decreed wars upon the face of the earth. …” (D&C 63:33.)\nIn Matthew, chapter 24, we learn of “famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes. …” (Matt. 24:7.) The Lord declared that these and other calamities shall occur. These particular prophecies seem not to be conditional. The Lord, with his foreknowledge, knows that they will happen. Some will come about through man’s manipulations; others through the forces of nature and nature’s God, but that they will come seems certain. Prophecy is but history in reverse—a divine disclosure of future events.\nYet, through all of this, the Lord Jesus Christ has said: “… if ye are prepared ye shall not fear.” (D&C 38:30.)\nWhat, then, is the Lord’s way to help us prepare for these calamities? The answer is also found in section 1 of the Doctrine and Covenants, wherein he says:\n“Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments;\n“And also gave commandments to others. …” (D&C 1:17–18.) He has also said: “Search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, and the prophecies and promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled.” (D&C 1:37.)\nHere then is the key—look to the prophets for the words of God, that will show us how to prepare for the calamities which are to come. For the Lord, in that same section, states: “What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.” (D&C 1:38.)\nAgain, the Lord warned those who will reject the inspired words of his representatives, in these words: “… and the day cometh that they who will not hear the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his servants, neither give heed to the words of the prophets and apostles, shall be cut off from among the people.” (D&C 1:14.)\nThe present-day Church welfare program was instituted by revelation from God to his mouthpiece, the prophet and earthly president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It was inaugurated by the First Presidency at a general conference of the Church held in October, 1936, thirty-seven years ago. It is significant that the man who served for a quarter century as the first managing director of the General Church Welfare Committee is today the Lord’s mouthpiece on earth, President Harold B. Lee, and that President Marion G. Romney, who was so closely associated with him in that endeavor, now stands as a counselor at his side.\nAt the April 1937 general conference of the Church, President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., of the First Presidency, asked: “What may we as a people and as individuals do for ourselves to prepare to meet this oncoming disaster, which God in his wisdom may not turn aside from us?” President Clark then set forth these inspired basic principles of the Church welfare program:\n“First, and above and beyond everything else, let us live righteously. …\n“Let us avoid debt as we would avoid a plague; where we are now in debt, let us get out of debt; if not today, then tomorrow.\n“Let us straitly and strictly live within our incomes, and save a little.\n“Let every head of every household see to it that he has on hand enough food and clothing, and, where possible, fuel also, for at least a year ahead. You of small means put your money in foodstuffs and wearing apparel, not in stocks and bonds; you of large means will think you know how to care for yourselves, but I may venture to suggest that you do not speculate. Let every head of every household aim to own his own home, free from mortgage. Let every man who has a garden spot, garden it; every man who owns a farm, farm it.” ( April 1937, p. 26.)\nFor the righteous the gospel provides a warning before a calamity, a program for the crises, a refuge for each disaster.\nThe Lord has said that “the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven …” (Mal. 4:1), but he assures us that “he that is tithed shall not be burned. …” (D&C 64:23.)\nThe Lord has warned us of famines, but the righteous will have listened to prophets and stored at least a year’s supply of survival food.\nThe Lord has set loose the angels to reap down the earth (see p. 251), but those who obey the Word of Wisdom along with the other commandments are assured “that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. …” (D&C 89:21.)\nThe Lord desires his Saints to be free and independent in the critical days ahead. But no man is truly free who is in financial bondage. “Think what you do when you run in debt,” said Benjamin Franklin, “you give to another power over your liberty.” “… pay thy debt and live …” said Elisha. (2 Kgs. 4:7.) And in the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord says, “… it is my will that you shall pay all your debts.” (D&C 104:78.)\nFor over 100 years we have been admonished to store up grain. “Remember the counsel that is given,” said Elder Orson Hyde, “‘… Store up all your grain,’ and take care of it! … And I tell you it is almost as necessary to have bread to sustain the body as it is to have food for the spirit; for the one is as necessary as the other to enable us to carry on the work of God upon the earth.” ( vol. 5, p. 17.) And he also said: “There is more salvation and security in wheat, than in all the political schemes of the world. …” ( vol. 2, p. 207.)\nAs to the foodstuffs which should be stored, the Church has left that decision primarily to the individual members. Some excellent suggestions are available from the Church Welfare Committee. “All grain is good for the food of man …” (D&C 89:16) the Lord states, but he particularly singles out wheat. Dry, whole, hard grains, when stored properly, can last indefinitely, and their nutritional value can be enhanced through sprouting, if desired.\nIt would be well if every family have on hand grain for at least a year. And may I remind you that it generally takes several times as much land to produce a given amount of food when grains are fed to livestock and we consume the meat. Let us be careful not to overdo beef cattle and other livestock projects on our welfare farms.\nFrom the standpoint of food production, storage, handling, and the Lord’s counsel, wheat should have high priority. Water, of course, is essential. Other basics could include honey or sugar, legumes, milk products or substitutes, and salt or its equivalent. The revelation to store food may be as essential to our temporal salvation today as boarding the ark was to the people in the days of Noah.\nPresident Harold B. Lee has wisely counseled that “perhaps if we think not in terms of a year’s supply of what we ordinarily would use, and think more in terms of what it would take to keep us alive in case we didn’t have anything else to eat, that last would be very easy to put in storage for a year … just enough to keep us alive if we didn’t have anything else to eat. We wouldn’t get fat on it, but we would live; and if you think in terms of that kind of annual storage rather than a whole year’s supply of everything that you are accustomed to eat which, in most cases, is utterly impossible for the average family, I think we will come nearer to what President Clark advised us way back in 1937.” (Welfare conference address, October 1, 1966.)\nThere are blessings in being close to the soil, in raising your own food, even if it is only a garden in your yard and/or a fruit tree or two. Man’s material wealth basically springs from the land and other natural resources. Combined with his human energy and multiplied by his tools, this wealth is assured and expanded through freedom and righteousness. Those families will be fortunate who, in the last days, have an adequate supply of each of these particulars.\nConcerning human energy, we can be grateful for the Word of Wisdom, which tells us it is possible to “run and not be weary, and … walk and not faint.” (D&C 89:20.) The Lord has advised us to “retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated.” (D&C 88:124.) He has also counseled, “Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength. …” (D&C 10:4.)\nHealthful foods, proper rest, adequate exercise, and a clean conscience can prepare us to tackle the trials that lie ahead.\nConcerning clothing, we should anticipate future needs, such as extra work clothes and clothes that would supply warmth during winter months when there may be shortages or lack of heating fuel. Leather and bolts of cloth could be stored, particularly for families with younger children who will outgrow and perhaps outwear their present clothes.\n“The day will come,” said President Wilford Woodruff, “when, as we have been told, we shall all see the necessity of making our own shoes and clothing and raising our own food. …” ( p. 166.)\nIn a message to the Saints in July of 1970, President Joseph Fielding Smith stated that the pioneers “were taught by their leaders to produce, as far as possible, all that they consumed … This is still excellent counsel.” ( vol. 73 [1970], p. 3.)\nWood, coal, gas, oil, kerosene, and even candles are among those items which could be reserved as fuel for warmth, cooking, and light or power. Some may be used for all of these purposes and certain ones would have to be stored and handled cautiously. It would also be well to have on hand some basic medical supplies to last for at least a year.\nMen should seek honorable employment and do their work well in order to provide for their own. Men who can perform useful skills with their hands will be in increasing demand. Handymen, farmers, builders, tailors, gardeners, and mechanics can and will prove a real blessing to their families and their fellowmen.\nThe Saints have been advised to pay their own way and maintain a cash reserve. Recent history has demonstrated that in difficult days it is reserves with intrinsic value that are of most worth, rather than reserves, the value of which may be destroyed through inflation. It is well to remember that continued government deficits cause inflation; inflation is used as an excuse for ineffective price controls; price controls lead to shortages; artificial shortages inevitably are used as an excuse to implement rationing.\nWhen will we learn these basic economic principles? However, “… when we really get into hard times,” said President Clark, “where food is scarce or there is none at all, and so with clothing and shelter, money may be no good for there may be nothing to buy, and you cannot eat money, you cannot get enough of it together to burn to keep warm, and you cannot wear it.” ( November 21, 1953, p. 4.)\nThe strength of the Church welfare program lies in every family following the inspired direction of the Church leaders to be self-sustaining through adequate preparation. God intends for his Saints to so prepare themselves “that the church [as the Lord has said] may stand independent above all other creatures beneath the celestial world.” (D&C 78:14.)\n“How on the face of the earth could a man enjoy his religion,” said Elder George A. Smith many years ago, “when he had been told by the Lord how to prepare for a day of famine, when, instead of doing so, he had fooled away that which would have sustained him and his family.” ( vol. 12, p. 142.)\nAnd President Brigham Young said, “If you are without bread, how much wisdom can you boast, and of what real utility are your talents, if you cannot procure for yourselves and save against a day of scarcity those substances designed to sustain your natural lives? … If you cannot provide for your natural lives, how can you expect to have wisdom to obtain eternal lives?” ( vol. 8, p. 68.)\nWhen will all these calamities strike? We do not know the exact time, but it appears it may be in the not-too-distant future. Those who are prepared now have the continuing blessings of early obedience, and they are ready. Noah built his ark before the flood came, and he and his family survived. Those who waited to act until after the flood began were too late.\nLet us not be dissuaded from preparing because of a seeming prosperity today, or a so-called peace.\nI have seen the ravages of inflation. I shall never forget Germany in the early 1920s. In December 1923 in Cologne, Germany, I paid six billion marks for breakfast. That was just 15 cents in American money. Today, the real inflation concern is in America and several other nations.\nBrethren and sisters, I know that this welfare program is inspired of God. I have witnessed with my own eyes the ravages of hunger and destitution as, under the direction of the president of the Church, I spent a year in war-torn Europe at the close of World War II, without my family, distributing food, clothing, and bedding to our needy members. I have looked into the sunken eyes of Saints, in almost the last stages of starvation. I have seen faithful mothers carrying their children, three and four years of age, who were unable to walk because of malnutrition. I have seen a hungry woman turn down food for a spool of thread. I have seen grown men weep as they ran their hands through the wheat and beans sent to them from Zion—America.\nThanks be to God for a prophet, for this inspired program, and for Saints who so managed their stewardship that they could provide for their own and still share with others. What a marvelous way to become a savior on Mount Zion!\n“The time is about ripe,” said President Lee, “for the demonstration of the power and efficacy of the Lord’s Plan which He designed as ‘a light to the world, and to be a standard for my people, and for the Gentiles to seek to it.’” ( Church section, December 20, 1941, p. 7; see also D&C 45:9.) May we ever remember the Lord’s promise: “… if ye are prepared ye shall not fear.” (D&C 38:30.)\nLet us live the gospel fully, and may we recognize the infallibility of God’s inspired word—whether by his “… own voice …” or the “voice of [his] my servants, it is the same.” (D&C 1:38.) The days ahead are sobering and challenging. Oh, may we be prepared spiritually and temporally, I pray humbly in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "At a news conference in Mexico City after the area conference, President Marion G. Romney was invited by a newsman to answer a question. The question was this: Do you have a welfare program in your church? And President Romney responded, “Yes, and if you join the Church, you can contribute to it also.”\nThat is a true principle of welfare and one that we should understand. Welfare is literally giving and not receiving in the Church of Jesus Christ.\nIn the 107th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, we read: “The office of a bishop is in administering all temporal things;” and also to be a judge in Israel, “to do the business of the church, to sit in judgment upon transgressors. …” (D&C 107:68, 72.)\nAnd then in the 72nd section, we read that he is to keep the bishops storehouse. (D&C 72:10.)\nNow in the Church in order to fill the bishops storehouse we have a commodity budget, and we assign this out to the regions; they in turn assign it to the stakes and the wards. In some cases it is in commodities and in some cases it is in money, cash in lieu. And as these funds come into the Church, then we use them to take care of the needs of the poor throughout the regions of the Church.\nNow, brethren, during the past year we have not taken sufficient into the bishops storehouse to have a full year’s inventory. We have about an eight and a half months’ inventory. This is partially due to the commodity price index rising from .185 on January 1 to .285 on August 1, 1973, on the wholesale index. Now you can see we had to use cash in lieu funds to buy products which are not produced in the storehouse. We used many of these funds for that purpose and this has been a factor in reducing our inventory to eight and a half months. We will build this back to a full year inventory at the end of this year.\nThe storehouse is to furnish the food for approximately 3 percent of the Church. Around 96,000 people receive commodities from the storehouse. We have a one-year inventory to supply needs for this 3 percent drawing from the storehouse. Brethren, bishops, those who administer these great funds and commodities, would you recall with me some principles that I think are urgent?\nFor example, in the bishops storehouse we have foods that are going to the homes of our less fortunate Saints. We feel possibly as you deal with these commodities you may need to make some slight adjustments. We feel the best commodities that are produced on our projects should be brought into the storehouses, not the culls from the farm or from the flocks or from the herds of cattle. We think it ought to be the very best, for do we not recall the scripture, “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto … the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.” (Matt. 25:40.) I believe that is a two-edged sword, and if we give to the Lord, or give to these fine Saints who receive from the bishops storehouse the culls, I believe then that we might be dealt with justly by the Lord in a like manner.\nNow there are some principles we also need to understand. One is this: when stake presidents and bishops contribute to the general committee from your projects, would you consider that we must have the very best. For example, we had one stake president in a nearby stake who the central storehouse called and said, “We need a few head of cattle.” The wholesale index that the Church was working on was a little under that which represented the present market. He said, “No, we won’t furnish you the cattle. We will sell them and then we will give you the cash in lieu,” which he did. They gave us the cash in lieu, brethren. We had to go out on the wholesale market and buy dressed beef at an up price. Now you think about that. It is all the Lord’s money. I don’t believe he would be pleased with that kind of a transaction. I wouldn’t want to offend anyone. I just think we ought to give the best we have to the Lord’s storehouse.\nI think there is another thing we must consider: have your eating habits changed a little over the past year? Ours have, greatly. We used to eat potatoes regularly, but when they got up to $1.69 for ten pounds, we decided to not eat as much of that product as we used to. We switched to rice. Our meat diet has considerably decreased. Our grocery mix has changed at home. However, we understand that those who are receiving commodities through the storehouse are receiving just as much meat as they were previously. Now we don’t want them to be treated any better or any worse than anyone else in the Church. We just want them to be treated with dignity, and so it might be well for you to adjust that mix a little bit as you are doing in your own homes.\nLet me give you a better example. In the business world every groceryman understands that in a particular section, if you want to raise the gross you don’t have to raise the price. You can raise the gross profit by changing the product mix. A very simple mathematical example will tell you how to do this. Let’s take for example, in one section you had a product markup of zero on 60 percent of your products in that section. Sixty percent times zero is zero. It contributes no gross points to the overall gross mark up. If you had a 20 percent mark up on the remaining 40 percent, 40 percent times 20 equals 8 percent, so you contributed eight gross points to your overall gross in that section.\nNow, brethren, let’s say we reversed things and took those high mark up items at 20 percent and displayed them on the heavy traffic impulse ends where the customers are more likely to buy, and took the low mark up items off those ends and put them on the shelf in a less favorable position, then we change the product mix. Now, say we get 20 percent markup on 60 percent of our gross and 0 percent on 40 percent. We get 40 percent times nothing is still nothing; 60 percent times 20 is 12 gross points, so we have increased our gross by four points by just changing the mix without having raised the price.\nBrethren, that is a great principle in welfare. Our home food bill is no more than it was six months ago or a year ago. We had to change the mix. We feel, bishops, you might well change the mix on those who are eating out of your bishops storehouse. When potatoes are $1.69 for ten pounds, let’s switch to rice. When meat is as high as it is, let’s not do as one bishop did, continue to give one family 67 pounds of beef each month. I don’t know that there are too many families here that are eating 67 pounds of beef each month. Those Saints receiving commodities through the bishops storehouse should not be receiving more than you are using in your homes. I hope this is a principle that we will remember and use very wisely.\nNow to those who raise beef and potatoes, please don’t be disenchanted with the Church. This is just Vaughn Featherstone speaking, not the prophet. We are trying to spend the Lord’s sacred funds in the best possible way. Use your Relief Society president as she goes into the homes to help determine how much should be used.\nIn Isaiah, the 58th chapter, the 6th verse, the Lord gives a great promise to those who contribute to the good of the Saints’ welfare. He said: “Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?\n“Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?”\nThen if you do this, he promises this: “Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am.” (Isa. 58:6–9.)\nNow brethren, if I gave to a fast offering fund or contributed to a welfare production project, I want to tell you that if I did it for no other reason than to know that when I would cry the Lord would say, “Here I am,” that would be motivation enough.\nNow a great, pure-in-heart King Benjamin said: “And ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain, and turn him out to perish.\n“Perhaps thou shalt say: The man has brought upon himself his misery; therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him of my food, nor impart unto him of my substance that he may not suffer, for his punishments are just—\n“But I say unto you, O man, whosoever doeth this the same hath great cause to repent; and except he repenteth of that which he hath done he perisheth forever, and hath no interest in the Kingdom of God.\n“For behold, are we not all beggars?” (Mosiah 4:16–19.)\nI believe King Benjamin laid it on the line with us, brethren. Now think about that principle. I believe if we would use wisdom as we deal with the bishops storehouse, I think the Lord would be pleased. Let’s use wisdom in distributing those sacred funds, those sacred commodities, and change the mix if necessary, but let’s do it righteously and with the best wisdom with which the Lord has blessed us.\nNow I would like to switch to a subject that I feel is welfare service-oriented. As President Lee discussed in his talk the great compromise in many different areas, I want to tell you what is going on in the area of work. The subject I would like to address myself to the young men of the Church is work. Brethren, there is no substitute for work. You cannot be lazy. Businesses who say, “Come with us and work for us; the wages are high and the labor is easy; the work week has been reduced considerably,” have only shame to offer. You are destroying your soul and character when you accept such an offer. The Lord expects us to be industrious; he expects us to be mentally and physically ambitious with all our hearts and souls. And I promise you this—that this compromise work attitude never was what the Lord intended.\nPresident J. Reuben Clark said: “We must purge our hearts of the love of ease; we must put from our lives the curse of idleness.” And then President Lee has said, “The greatest poverty is the poverty of desire.” President Kimball said, “Only the mediocre person is always at his best.” And Brother Thomas S. Monson has said in his W formula: “Work will win when wishy-washy wishing won’t.” Dorothea Brande in her book (Cornerstone Library, Inc., New York, 1968), says that we ought to “act as though it were impossible to fail.” That is true, brethren, in the Church. The Lord wants us to be successful, and it is especially true here.\nThere is a modern-day version of “The Little Red Hen” that I would like to leave with you. I think it is very impressive. It is simply this:\n\n“Said the big white rooster, ‘Gosh all hemlock; things are really tough,\nSeems that worms are getting scarcer and I cannot find enough;\nWhat’s become of all those fat ones is a mystery to me;\nThere were thousands through the rosy spell but now where can they be?’\n\n“The little red hen who heard him didn’t grumble or complain,\nShe had gone through lots of dry spells, she had lived through floods of rain;\nSo she flew up on the grindstone and she gave her claws a whet,\nAs she said: ‘I’ve never seen the time there were no worms to get.’\nShe picked a new and undug spot—the earth was hard and firm,\nThe big white rooster jeered, ‘New ground! That’s no place for a worm.’\n\n“The little red hen just spread her feet, she dug both fast and free,\n‘I must go to the worms,’ she said, ‘the worms won’t come to me.’\n\n“The rooster vainly spent his day, through habit, by the ways\nWhere fat worms have passed in squads, back in the rainy days.\nWhen nightfall found him supperless, he growled in accents rough,\n‘I’m hungry as a fowl can be—conditions sure are tough.’\nHe turned then to the little red hen and said, ‘It’s worse with you,\n‘For you’re not only hungry but you must be tired, too.\n‘I rested while I watched for worms so I feel fairly perk,\n‘But how are you? Without worms, too? And after all that work.’\n\n“The little red hen hopped to her perch and dropped her eyes to sleep,\nAnd murmured in a drowsy tone, ‘Young man, hear this and weep,\nI’m full of worms and happy, for I’ve dined both long and well,\nThe worms are there as always—but I had to dig like heck.’\n\n“Oh, here and there, white roosters still are holding sales positions,\nThey cannot do much business now, because of poor conditions,\nBut soon as things get right again, they’ll sell a hundred firms—\nMeanwhile the little red hens are out a-gobbling up the worms.”\n\nI am indebted to a good friend of mine, Aldin Porter, for a story and I would like to share it with you. He shared it with me about two years ago.\n“No one in our Utah town knew where the Countess had come from; her carefully precise English indicated that she was not a native American. From the size of her house and staff we knew that she must be wealthy, but she never entertained and she made it clear that when she was at home she was completely inaccessible. Only when she stepped outdoors did she become at all a public figure—and then chiefly to the small fry of the town, who lived in awe of her.\n“The countess always carried a cane, not only for support, but as a means of chastising any youngster she thought needed disciplining. And at one time or another most of the kids in our neighborhood seemed to display that need. By running fast and staying alert, I had managed to keep out of her reach. But one day when I was about thirteen, as I was short-cutting through her hedge, she got close enough to rap my head with her stick.\n“‘Ouch!’ I yelled, jumping a couple of feet.\n“‘Young man, I want to talk to you,’ she said. I was expecting a lecture on the evils of trespassing, but as she looked at me, half smiling, she seemed to change her mind.\n“‘Don’t you live in that green house with the willow trees in the next block?’\n“‘Yes, ma’am.’ …\n“‘Good. I’ve lost my gardener. Be at my house Thursday morning at seven, and don’t tell me you have something else to do; I’ve seen you slouching around on Thursdays.’\n“When the Countess gave an order, it was carried out. I didn’t dare not come on that next Thursday. I went over the whole lawn three times with a mower before she was satisfied, and then she had me down on all fours looking for weeds until my knees were as green as the grass. She finally called me up to the porch.\n“‘Well, young man, how much do you want for your day’s work?’\n“‘I don’t know. Fifty cents, maybe.’\n“‘Is that what you figure you’re worth?”\n“‘Yes’m. About that.’\n“‘Very well. Here’s the fifty cents you say you’re worth, and here’s the dollar and a half more that I’ve earned for you by pushing you. Now I’m going to tell you something about how you and I are going to work together. There are as many ways of mowing a lawn as there are people, and they may be worth anywhere from a penny to five dollars. Let’s say that a three-dollar job would be just what you have done today, except that you’d have to be something of a fool to spend that much time on a lawn. A five-dollar lawn is—well, it’s impossible, so we’ll forget about that. Now then, each week I’m going to pay you according to your own evaluation of your work.’\n“I left with my two dollars, richer than I remembered being in my whole life, and determined that I would get four dollars out of her the next week. But I failed to reach even the three dollar mark. My will began to falter the second time around her yard.\n“‘Two dollars again, eh? That kind of job puts you right on the edge of being dismissed, young man.’\n“‘Yes’m. But I’ll do better next week.’\n“And somehow I did. The last time around the lawn I was exhausted, but I found I could spur myself on. In the exhilaration of that new feeling, I had no hesitation in asking the Countess for three dollars.\n“Each Thursday for the next four or five weeks, I varied between a three- and a three-and-a-half dollar job. The more I became more acquainted with her lawn, places where the ground was a little high or a little low, places where it needed to be clipped short or left long on the edges to make a more satisfying curve along the garden, the more I became aware of just what a four-dollar lawn would consist of. And each week I would resolve to do just that kind of a job. But by the time I had made my three dollar or three and-a-half dollar mark I was too tired to remember even having had the ambition to go beyond that.\n“‘You look like a good consistent $3.50 man,’ she would say as she handed me the money.\n“‘I guess so’ I would say, too happy at the sight of the money to remember that I had shot for something higher.\n“‘Well, don’t feel too bad,’ she would comfort me. ‘After all, there are only a handful of people in the world who could do a four-dollar job.’\n“And her words were a comfort at first, but then, without my noticing what was happening, her comfort became an irritant that made me resolve to do that four-dollar job, even if it killed me. In the fever of my resolve, I could see myself expiring on her lawn, with the Countess leaning over me, handing me the four dollars with a tear in her eye, begging my forgiveness for having thought I couldn’t do it.\n“It was in the middle of such a fever, one Thursday night when I was trying to forget the day’s defeat and get some sleep, that the truth hit me so hard that I sat upright, half choking in my excitement. It was the five-dollar job I had to do, not the four-dollar one! I had to do the job that no one could do because it was impossible.\n“I was well acquainted with the difficulties ahead. I had the problem, for example, of doing something about the worm mounds in the lawn. The Countess might not even have noticed them yet, they were so small; but in my bare feet I knew about them and I had to do something about them. And I could go on trimming the garden edges with shears, but I knew that a five-dollar lawn demanded that I line up each edge exactly with a yard stick and then trim it precisely with the edger. And there were other problems that only I and my bare feet knew about.\n“I started the next Thursday by ironing out the worm mounds with a heavy roller. After two hours of that I was ready to give up for the day. Nine o’clock in the morning, and my will was already gone! It was only by accident that I discovered how to regain it. Sitting under a walnut tree for a few minutes after finishing the rolling, I fell asleep. When I woke up minutes later, the lawn looked so good and felt so good under my feet, I was anxious to get on with the job.\n“I followed this secret for the rest of the day, dozing for a few minutes every hour to regain my perspective and replenish my strength. Between naps, I mowed four times, two times lengthwise, two times across, until the lawn looked like a green velvet checkerboard. Then I dug around every tree, crumbling the big clods and smoothing the soil with my hands, then finished with the edger, meticulously lining up each stroke so that the effect would be perfectly symmetrical. And I carefully trimmed the grass between the flagstones of the front walk. The shears wore my fingers raw, but the walk never looked better.\n“Finally about eight o’clock that evening … it was all completed. I was so proud I didn’t even feel tired when I went up to her door.\n“‘Well, what is it today?’ she asked.\n“‘Five dollars,’ I said, trying for a little calm and sophistication.\n“‘Five dollars? You mean four dollars, don’t you? I told you that a five-dollar lawn job isn’t possible.’\n“‘Yes it is. I just did it.’\n“‘Well, young man, the first five-dollar lawn in history certainly deserves some looking around.’\n“We walked about the lawn together in the light of evening, and even I was quite overcome by the impossibility of what I had done.\n“‘Young man,’ she said, putting her hand on my shoulder, ‘what on earth made you do such a crazy, wonderful thing?’\n“I didn’t know why, but even if I had, I could not have explained it in the excitement of hearing that I had done it.\n“‘I think I know,’ she continued, ‘how you felt when this idea first came to you of caring for a lawn that I told you was impossible. It made you very happy when it first came, then a little frightened. Am I right?’\n“She could see she was right by the startled look on my face.\n“‘I know how you felt, because the same thing happens to almost everyone. They feel this sudden burst in them of wanting to do some great thing. They feel a wonderful happiness, but then it passes because they have said, “No, I can’t do that. It’s impossible.” Whenever something in you says, “It’s impossible,” remember to take a careful look and see if it isn’t really God asking you to grow an inch, or a foot, or a mile, that you may come to a fuller life.’ …\n“Since that time, some 25 years ago, when I have felt myself at an end with nothing before me, suddenly, with the appearance of that word, ‘impossible,’ I have experienced the unexpected lift, the leap inside me, and known that the only possible way lay through the very middle of impossible.” (Richard Thurman, “The Countess and the Impossible,” June 1958.)\nNow, my brethren in the Church, all things are possible in the Church. We can accomplish anything. This is the Lord’s work. I want to testify to you that we must be wise. Don’t be a sluggard. Do a day’s work. Give it your heart and soul, and the Lord will bless you with success and prosper you. This is his kingdom.\nEmma Lazarus has written words which describe the great Statue of Liberty. These words have special meaning to us in the Church, for truly these same words entreating all to come to America may well apply to the Church. I will just quote the last few lines. She said:\n\n“Give me your tired, your poor,\nYour huddled masses yearning to breathe free;\nThe wretched refuse of your teeming shore,\nSend these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,\nI lift my lamp beside the golden door.”\n\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ is the golden door, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen."

        "content": "Tonight we meet in what is possibly the largest gathering of priesthood members in the history of this world. May we congratulate each of you for being here where the Lord would have you be. Your very presence is an indication of your faith and your desire to be a vital part of the kingdom of God.\nOur message to the world is that he lives, that the heavens have been opened, that priesthood authority has been restored, and that a living prophet stands at our head.\nWe regard as scripture that chapter of the Pearl of Great Price that records the precious thoughts and words of the Prophet Joseph Smith as he recounts the astounding events that occurred in the spring of 1820. He said he did it to “put all inquirers after truth in possession of the facts, as they have transpired. …” (JS—H 1:1.) He further states: “… I shall present the various events … in truth and righteousness. …” (JS—H 1:2.)\nYou will remember that, after recounting some family history and commenting about religious unrest in the community, the Prophet tells of being impressed by the scripture found in James, chapter 1, verse 5, which reads: “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.” Then the Prophet said:\n“Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. …\n“… I at length came to the determination to ‘ask of God,’ concluding that if he gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom, and would give liberally, and not upbraid, I might venture.\n“So, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of God, I retired to the woods to make the attempt. It was on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty. It was the first time in my life that I had made such an attempt, for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the attempt to pray vocally.” (JS—H 1:12–14.)\nDoes this sound like a 14 1/2-year-old boy? Then he said:\n“After I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desire of my heart to God. I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak. Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction.\n“But, exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me out of the power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into despair and abandon myself to destruction—not to an imaginary ruin, but to the power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had such marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being—just at this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.\n“It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!” (JS—H 1:15–17.)\nNow, brethren, we have just recounted together the most significant singular event in the world since the resurrection of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The First Vision is the very foundation of this Church, and it is my conviction that each member of this Church performs his duty in direct ratio to his personal testimony and faith in the First Vision. How well do you believe this story? No man having heard the Joseph Smith testimony can, in good conscience, remain on neutral ground.\nJoseph Smith was an ordinary boy with a rather ordinary name, but he was now to become an extraordinary prophet. For nine long years following the First Vision Joseph prepared for the privilege of the priesthood. As you remember, it was John the Baptist who appeared on the banks of the Susquehanna in answer to a fervent prayer offered by Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. How simple the words for such a historic occasion:\n“Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah, I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and this shall never be taken again from the earth until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness.\n“He said this Aaronic Priesthood had not the power of laying on hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, but that this should be conferred on us hereafter; and he commanded us to go and be baptized, and gave us directions that I should baptize Oliver Cowdery, and that afterwards he should baptize me.\n“Accordingly,” continues the Prophet, “we went and were baptized. I baptized him first, and afterwards he baptized me—after which I laid my hands upon his head and ordained him to the Aaronic Priesthood, and afterwards he laid his hands on me and ordained me to the same Priesthood—for so we were commanded.” (JS—H 1:69–71.)\nIt was just a few weeks later that Peter, James, and John appeared to confer the Melchizedek Priesthood and the apostleship upon these same two men. That priesthood authority remains today in an unbroken chain. How reassuring to know that God’s house is a house of order and that the same great leaders of 2,000 years ago were privileged to reestablish true priesthood authority on the earth. The logical sequence of events and the personages involved help to confirm the divine nature of all that transpired on that historic occasion.\nIt was in the following year, 1830, that the Church was organized. At last truth was established and continuing revelation was assured.\nThen nearly six years later at the Kirtland Temple on a Sabbath afternoon, the Lord himself appeared in glorious vision to Joseph and Oliver. That same day Moses, Elias, and Elijah also appeared, each ancient prophet restoring an important function of the gospel. Listen again to the glorious description of the Savior’s appearance as recounted by the Prophet Joseph Smith:\n“The veil was taken from our minds, and the eyes of our understanding were opened.\n“We saw the Lord standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit, before us; and under his feet was a paved work of pure gold, in color like amber.\n“His eyes were as a flame of fire; the hair of his head was white like the pure snow; his countenance shone above the brightness of the sun; and his voice was as the sound of the rushing of great waters, even the voice of Jehovah. …” (D&C 110:1–3.)\nThe Savior then delivered a message that we should all read on occasion. It is recorded in the 110th section of the Doctrine and Covenants.\nWe attending this meeting tonight have accepted the obligation of priesthood. The commitment has been made, and there is really no excuse for failure because “… the Lord giveth no commandments [or commission] unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.” (1 Ne. 3:7.) With a promise like that, there is really no excuse for us to fail.\nNow, brethren of the priesthood, after reviewing these divine appearances—God the Father; Jesus Christ, his Son; John the Baptist; Peter, James, and John; and other ancient prophets—doesn’t this make you excited about this great work!\nKnowing that these events transpired, if I were a young deacon all over again, I would pass the sacrament like it was one of the most important things I had to do all week. My every act and my appearance would be in strict harmony with the dignity and honor of the position entrusted to me by the Savior.\nThe gathering of fast offerings would take on a rich, new meaning, and I would remind myself as I approached each home that I was the bishop’s personal representative, that poor and needy people would be blessed more abundantly as a result of my efforts to participate in what James described as “pure religion and undefiled.” (See James 1:27.)\nIf I were a young teacher or priest again, I would strive to really be an asset to my home teaching companion. I would try harder to cement friendships with the members we visit. I would attempt to lift people like the Savior did. My responsibility toward the sacrament would be regarded as a rich, spiritual experience, never to be taken lightly. To participate in a sacred ordinance with anything but our highest respect and best effort is a disservice to the people of the ward and a betrayal of the true Spirit of Christ.\nIf I were one of you young adults over 25 and still unmarried, I would start looking for someone who has the potential for perfection instead of someone who has already achieved it. Just off the record, and quite confidentially, it is my understanding that there is only one perfect girl produced in each century, and I have already found her; she is all mine.\nIf I were a young father just starting out, I would practice kindness, patience, and love unfeigned. I would check my priority system constantly just to make certain that my course was true and that eternal life was my destiny.\nIf I were a prospective elder, I would give myself to some kind of Church service and at the same time set out to improve my gospel scholarship on a daily basis so that my family could be sealed to me for all eternity.\nIf I were an active Melchizedek Priesthood holder, high councilor, member of the stake presidency, member of a bishopric, and especially if I had children at home, knowing all that I know about eternity, I would remember above all else the wise counsel of the past: that if you spend all your days and save the whole world but lose your own family, you will be counted as an unprofitable servant.\nBrethren, four great statements I leave with you to ponder. First, the words of God the Eternal Father, “This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!” [JS—H 1:17] Not 2,000 years ago, but in our time.\nNext, the memorable words of John the Baptist who declared with authority: “Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah I confer the Priesthood of Aaron …” (D&C 13) in our day.\nThird, the Savior’s statement about: “Peter, and James, and John, whom I have sent unto you, by whom I have ordained you and confirmed you …” (D&C 27:12) happening in our time of the world’s history.\nAnd fourth, from Kirtland, as recorded by the Prophet Joseph: “We saw the Lord standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit, before us; and under his feet was a paved work of pure gold, in color like amber.” (D&C 110:2.)\nIndeed, fellow priesthood holders, these statements are not the idle words of men. We live in a remarkable time. The Lord has spoken in our day. You and I have received the message. Our fundamental obligation is to the priesthood of God which cannot be regarded casually, as though it were a man-made club or a mere fraternal organization.\nI testify with all the sobriety of my heart and soul that we are committed, that we are depended upon. All things are possible in the Lord; President Lee made this crystal clear this morning in his masterful discourse at the welfare services meeting. As we unite in our faith and determination, His work will be accomplished. May this obligation burn within us. May it never be dimmed. May we be excited about the opportunity that is ours as we move forward deliberately, in humility, and with constant preparation, and do what we have to do. And I pray it in the name of Jesus Christ, the Master. Amen."

        "content": "Brethren, you who were at the welfare meeting this morning heard President Tanner say that we had installed approximately 1,400 new bishops during this last year. It is therefore thought advisable that we say something about the fundamentals of Church welfare. As I talk to you, I shall quote from handbooks and speeches given in the past. Sources are noted in my manuscript.\nChurch welfare is an approach to the law of consecration—the Lord’s perfect economic program. Of Enoch and his people who implemented that perfect program it is written:\n“… the Lord blessed the land, and … called his people Zion, because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them.\n“… and lo, Zion, in process of time, was taken up into heaven. …” (Moses 7:17–18, 21.)\nOf the Nephites who survived the cataclysm which accompanied the crucifixion of Jesus and thereafter lived the program, the record says:\n“And it came to pass [that] … the people were all converted unto the Lord, … and there were no contentions and disputations among them, and every man did deal justly one with another.\n“And they had all things common among them; therefore there were not rich and poor, bond and free, but they were all made free, and partakers of the heavenly gift.\n“… and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God.” (4 Ne. 1:2–3, 16.)\nThe basis of God’s perfect economic program is labor. In Eden the Lord said to Adam:\n“… Because thou hast … eaten of the fruit of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying—Thou shalt not eat of it, cursed shall be the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.\n“By the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, until thou shalt return unto the ground. …” (Moses 4:23, 25.)\nNow this was not a vindictive decree. The Lord was not retaliating against Adam. He was simply placing Adam in a situation where he would have to work to live.\nThe ground was cursed in the manner prescribed for Adam’s sake, not to his disadvantage. Had Adam and his posterity been able to live without working, the human race would never have survived. Idleness is pernicious.\nRecently my secretary put on my desk an article which reported an experiment carried on by the National Institute of Mental Health. “A tiny Eden for mice” was built. In it was placed everything that could be included “in a mouse’s dream of paradise. Food, housing supplies—everything was there in abundance.” In it were placed four pair of mice. There was room for “4,000 mice. Every 55 days the population doubled. But when there were a little over 600 mice things began happening. Not only did the population fall off; but big problems arose in the mouse society. … the mice were becoming lazy. Many appeared greatly distressed, some utterly frustrated. Their behavior became quite unpredictable. The making of nests dropped off. Some of the mice began to eat each other!\n“The planned mouse population never did climb to 4,000. They had reached slightly more than half that figure when reproduction came to a complete halt. The mouse society turned into an emotional mob!\n“The population in mouse-Eden has now dropped to a little more than 600. No new baby mice are being born. The mouse society is doomed. And not a mouse shows any interest in saving his dying paradise.” (Lon Woodrum, Sept. 1973, pp. 28–30.)\nIdleness is just as devastating to men as it is to mice.\n“Give [men] everything they ask for while making no demands on their own efforts, and they will deteriorate into an unfit mob.” (Ibid.)\nThis is the lesson of all history. “My experience has taught me,” said President Brigham Young, “and it has become a principle with me, that it is never any benefit to give, out and out, to man or woman, money, food, clothing, or anything else, if they are able-bodied, and can work and earn what they need, … This is my principle and I try to act upon it. To pursue a contrary course would ruin any community in the world and make them idlers.” ( 1925 edition, p. 422.)\nThe Lord himself in revealing the gospel in this dispensation, said:\n“Thou shalt not be idle; for he that is idle shall not eat the bread nor wear the garments of the laborer.” (D&C 42:42.)\nAnd to the missionaries, he said, “Thou shalt not idle away thy time. …” (D&C 60:13.)\n“… the inhabitants of Zion,” he added, “… shall remember their labors … in all faithfulness; for the idler shall be had in remembrance before the Lord.” (D&C 68:30.) And finally he decreed:\n“Let every man be diligent in all things. And the idler shall not have place in the church, except he repent and mend his ways.” (D&C 75:29.)\nPerhaps we can appropriately say concerning the implementation of this edict what President Brigham Young said about the payment of tithing:\n“They say we cut people off the Church for not paying tithing; we never have yet, but they ought to be. God does not fellowship them.” ( 1925 edition, p. 274.)\nThink about that, you who have trouble paying tithing. “God does not fellowship them.”\nPursuant to the foregoing principles and instructions, “… welfare workers … [must] earnestly teach and urge Church members to be self-sustaining to the full extent of their powers. No true Latter-day Saint will, while physically able, voluntarily shift from himself the burden of his own support. So long as he can, under the inspiration of the Almighty and with his own labors, he will supply himself with the necessities of life. We should not forget these principles when we administer the Church Welfare Program.\n“Obviously no person should become a charge upon the public [or upon the Church] when his relatives are able to care for him. Every consideration of kinship, of justice and fairness, of the common good, and even of humanity itself, requires this. Therefore all Church welfare workers will urge to the utmost the caring for the needy by their kin, if they have sufficient funds or supplies to enable them to do so. Where Church relatives, financially competent to take care of their kin, refuse to do so, the matter should be reported to the bishop of the ward in which such relatives reside.” ( 1952, p. 2.)\nThis last statement was approved by the First Presidency of the Church years ago. We must not forget or neglect our family obligations in this respect.\nPaul writing to Timothy declared that “… if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.” (1 Tim. 5:8.)\nTo the Church in this dispensation, the Lord gave this law:\n“Women have claim on their husbands for their maintenance, until their husbands are taken; …\n“All children have claim upon their parents for their maintenance until they are of age.” (D&C 83:2, 4.)\nAlthough each of us is under divine command to work and sustain ourselves and our families, the varied circumstances under which we live make it impossible for all Church members and families to be at all times self-sustaining.\nBefore the Church had been organized a year, the Lord made it abundantly clear that such poor, that is, those who by their efforts and the help of their families cannot sustain themselves, are to be cared for by the Church.\n“… for your salvation [he said] I give unto you a commandment, [speaking to the Church] for I have heard your prayers, and the poor have complained before me [this was when the Church was but nine months old], and the rich I have made, and all flesh is mine, and I am no respecter of persons.\n“… I say unto you, be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine.”\nWe hear this quoted, and properly so, about being one in many ways, but when this was given, the Lord was talking about the poor and the rich. He continued:\n“And now, I give unto the church in these parts a commandment, that certain men among them shall be appointed, and they shall look to the poor and the needy, and administer to their relief that they shall not suffer. …” (D&C 38:16, 27, 34–35.)\n“… repeatedly [thereafter, He emphasized] the duty of the Saints to look after the poor. …”\nIn the revelation referred to by the Lord as “the law of my church,” he said:\n“‘… behold, thou wilt remember the poor, and consecrate of thy properties for their support. … And inasmuch as ye impart of your substance unto the poor, ye will do it unto me.’ (D&C 42:30, 31.)\n“… later the Lord said:\n“‘Behold, I say unto you, that ye must visit the poor and the needy and administer to their relief. …” (D&C 44:6.)\n“Still later:\n“‘Wo unto you rich men, that will not give your substance to the poor, for your riches will canker your souls; and this shall be your lamentation in the day of visitation, and of judgment, and of indignation: The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and my soul is not saved!’ (D&C 56:16.)\n“And when giving instructions regarding the united order, the Lord said:\n“‘Therefore, if any man shall take of the abundance which I have made, and impart not his portion, according to the law of my gospel, unto the poor and the needy, he shall, with the wicked, lift up his eyes in hell, being in torment.’ (D&C 104:18.)” ( 1933, p. 4.)\nIn light of these teachings it seems to me that every Church member, and particularly every priesthood bearer who wishes peace and joy here and eternal life hereafter, would give bounteously of his sustenance to the poor.\nWhile all Church members are required to give, the bishop is the Lord’s authorized representative to administer Church relief to the needy. On this aspect of Church welfare I quote President Clark:\n“… By the word of the Lord the sole mandate to care for and the sole discretion in caring for, the poor of the Church is lodged in the bishop. … It is his duty and his only to determine to whom, when, how, and how much shall be given to any member of his ward from Church funds and as ward help. …\n“Help given by the bishop is different from help given by other organizations and agencies.\n“Relief by public agencies is given primarily from political, social, or economic considerations. Moral and spiritual considerations play a secondary part. The welfare of the State, not the upbuilding of the individual, is the measure. …\n“Relief by private non-church agencies and individuals is often motivated by the highest considerations. … But in this giving, the emphasis is rather on the giver than the receiver. …\n“But the help given by the bishop is wholly different from either [public agencies or private charities]. …\n“In the first place, the church is expressly and directly commanded to care for its poor and needy, and the bishop is charged with the responsibility of carrying it out, and is given all the rights, prerogatives, and functions necessary therefor.\n“In the next place, the standard of care has been indicated. The bishop has been directed [by the Lord] ‘To keep the Lord’s storehouse; to receive the funds of the church … and to administer to their wants. …’ (D&C 72:10–11.)” (Unpublished article by President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., on the role of bishops and the Relief Society, July 9, 1941.)\nIn his administering aid to the needy the bishop must ever keep in mind that in doing so he is the Lord’s agent and that the Lord said:\n“… it is my purpose to provide for my saints. …\n“But it must needs be done in mine own way; and behold this is the way that I, the Lord, have decreed to provide for my saints, that the poor shall be exalted, in that the rich are made low.” (D&C 104:15–16.)\nAnd the bishops must never forget that the only way the poor can be exalted in receiving assistance is to be given the opportunity and be required to work, to the extent of their ability, for what they receive. The dignity and self-respect of the receiver must be preserved.\nWe shall have taken a long stride forward in the Lord’s perfect economic program when (1) everyone contributes to Church welfare in the spirit of the widow’s mite; (2) everybody works individually to sustain himself and discharge his family responsibilities in this respect; and (3) when everyone helped through the bishops storehouse desires, and is assisted to obtain, the opportunity to work; for after all, the real purpose of caring for the poor and the needy according to the Lord’s plan is not merely to give temporal help but to save souls.\n“The rule of the bishop in all these matters is the rule of the priesthood—a rule of kindness, charity, love [and] righteousness.” (Unpublished article by President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., on the role of bishops and the Relief Society, July 9, 1941.)\n“No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned;\n“By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile.” (D&C 121:41–42.)\nGod bless us in performing this great service, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "What a tremendous thing it is to think of 180,000 priesthood holders meeting in 800 different groups throughout Canada and the United States to listen to a prophet’s voice and to be instructed. This is the greatest gathering of priesthood holders in the history of the Church.\nI am always humbled and inspired and encouraged as I stand before a body of the priesthood, realizing that they have been chosen, ordained, and set apart and authorized to act in the name of the Lord, to be a light unto the world, and to so live and use their influence to thwart the ways of Satan. There are many young boys in our priesthood gatherings tonight.\nOne of my grandsons said just this week, when it was mentioned what he needed to do to gain certain things, “Well, that is a long way in the future.” I think when we are talking about our duties in the priesthood, especially with our younger people, and I am sorry to say with so many old people, too, who think they will never die, they think it is a long way in the future. They seem to think they can live this way today, and they can live the way the Lord wants them to tomorrow.\nI would like to have these young men try to listen to what I have to say because it is in your best interest. You hold the priesthood; you have been chosen to come forward in these latter days to hold the priesthood of God in the only church in the world which has the priesthood of God. You are given the opportunity to act in his name; you have made covenants with the Lord to magnify your priesthood, and help build the kingdom of God here upon the earth. You have been given this promise:\n“For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining of these two priesthoods of which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies.\n“They become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of Abraham, and the church and kingdom, and the elect of God.\n“… therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him.” (D&C 84:33–34, 38.)\nNow note the commandment the Lord gives unto all priesthood holders:\n“And I now give unto you a commandment to beware concerning yourselves, to give diligent heed to the words of eternal life.\n“For you shall live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God.” (D&C 84:43–44.)\nNever before has your strength and influence been needed more than now to combat the evils of the world which are as predicted and recorded in Second Nephi. Speaking of this day, and referring to the devil, Nephi says:\n“For behold, at that day shall he rage in the hearts of the children of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good.\n“And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well—and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell.” (2 Ne. 28:20–21.)\nBrethren, we seem to think that is a long way away, and when we die we won’t be well met unless we are prepared to do what the Lord has asked us to do.\nIf we are to accomplish what we have been called and set apart to do, we must honor our priesthood, magnify our calling, and as President Lee has admonished, love God and keep his commandments. To keep the commandments requires self-discipline and obedience to the law. Obedience is the first law of heaven, and it is obedience to the laws of God that I should like to talk about particularly, because these laws affect not only our happiness and well-being here upon the earth, but are essential to our eternal life.\nFirst I should like to emphasize that one of the greatest gifts that God has given to man is his free agency. You may choose your life and what you will be. But the Lord has said; “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (John 14:15), whether you are boys or men.\nI should like to read a little poem which most of you have heard—some, many times:\n\n“Know this, that every soul is free\nTo choose his life and what he’ll be,\nFor this eternal truth is given\nThat God will force no man to heav’n.\n\n“He’ll call, persuade, direct aright,\nAnd bless with wisdom, love and light,\nIn nameless ways be good and kind,\nBut never force the human mind.\n\n“Freedom and reason make us men;\nTake these away, what are we then?\nMere animals, and just as well\nThe beasts may think of heav’n or hell.”\n\nWe have the laws, we may choose how we will apply them. We must be prepared, however, to take the consequences of our choices. All laws of God are for our good and welfare and benefit. Through obedience we will be blessed. If disobedient, we will suffer, though sometimes the consequences may be much later.\nSelf-discipline is the basis of our success. Man has been given a mind to think, to ponder, and to understand and decide what he wants to do and whether or not the sacrifice and discipline is worth it; and, in the Church, whether or not he can stand the ridicule and pressure of those with whom he associates. You have been called. You have been given the priesthood. You have been given the gospel. You are an example to the world. Be a good one.\nThe measure of our success depends on our decision, our determination, discipline, and dependability. But let us always remember that the Lord has said:\n“When we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.” (D&C 130:21.)\nHe also said:\n“I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise.” (D&C 82:10.)\nThe laws of nature are inflexible and rigid and right. Through ignorance or deliberate intent, if you touch a hot stove, you are going to be burned; or if you touch a high voltage wire, you will suffer the consequences. If you say, I am going to defy gravity and jump off a high building or a high precipice, you might say halfway down, “All is going well.”\nWhen you think of the sun, the moon, the stars, and when you think of the eclipse of the sun and the moon, though years may pass between one time and another, still the scientists can tell you to the exact minute when the sun will be eclipsed and where you can see it best. What a terrible thing it would be if we couldn’t depend upon the sun coming up in the morning. How uncomfortable we would be if it were just a few hours late. We would freeze, and there would be very little life, if any, left upon the earth, just because the sun said, “Well, I won’t do it today.”\nThose who were in the Skylab and Apollo programs never thought of laws as restricting them in what they were doing, but they used them as a means by which they could determine how to do it. They and all who were associated with them spent years concentrating, trying to live and do those things which the laws of nature commanded.\nIt is an interesting thing when we are training animals, we expect those animals to do exactly what they are told, and we will spend hours, we will spend days, and we will spend weeks, and we will spend months training a hunting dog or a sheep dog or a horse; and they do the same in a circus with their circus animals. Those men who are acrobats in a circus spend months and years in preparing to do those things that are necessary, using all the laws and obeying those laws to accomplish what they wish to do.\nThis is true with anything in life. But we are prepared to spend that time and give rewards to our animals when they do right and punish them otherwise, and if they won’t do what we tell them and we can’t train them, we dispose of them. How much more important that we take time to train our children to do what is right, and ourselves as children of God, to do what is right, and to be sure we are where we should be when we should be, doing the things we should be doing in keeping the commandments of God, being obedient in every way. As we do this, we can gain eternal life. How true this is!\nPriesthood holders, how fortunate and how blessed to have the scriptures, the word of God, to guide us, and a prophet of God to direct us. We have our quorums and leaders to instruct and teach us correct principles and encourage us.\nHow important that we listen to the prophet’s voice and govern ourselves and obey the teachings of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, who gave his life for us, and gave us the gospel as our guide. We should always remember what Joseph Smith, the Prophet, said:\n“Whatever God requires is right, no matter what it is, although we may not see the reason thereof until all of the events transpire.”\nOften throughout the ages man has not known or understood why certain laws were given, but through faith in God, he has accepted and kept the commandments, if he were wise.\nAdam, when asked why he offered sacrifice, said, “I know not, save the Lord commanded me.” (Moses 5:6.) That was enough for Adam, and he kept the commandments. Imagine yourself being in Noah’s place when the Lord told him to go and build an ark. There was no rain or anything to worry about, but he was told to go and build an ark; and he set about to build the ark and he followed directions. But there were many people who did not follow; they didn’t believe; they thought it was a long way away and wouldn’t happen, and you know the result.\nLehi was directed to leave Jerusalem, and you know objections were raised by his family. Some questioned his sanity, but he followed and accepted the words of the Lord and was obedient to them, and the Lord directed Nephi to build a ship to take them across the waters.\nI wonder if anyone here can tell us why the Lord has said that we should be baptized by immersion. We are obedient to that. Why the laying on of hands? Why can’t we just say, “Yes, I would like to be a member of this Church,” and let it go at that?\nWhen the Word of Wisdom was given, many people questioned it, and many didn’t accept it as the word of the Lord. Some say it was not a commandment, but when the Lord said he would like you to do it, to me that is commandment enough. I have an article here that refers to the use of nicotine. It was written 140 years after the Word of Wisdom was given. At the beginning of the article these statements appear:\n“It attacks the lungs, the heart, and the brain. It has killed more people than the great epidemics of typhoid, tuberculosis and yellow fever.”\nAt the conclusion of the article it says that “all of the epidemics of typhoid throughout Western Europe since the beginning of the 16th century have caused fewer estimated deaths than the total number known to be caused by cigarettes in one year in the United States.”\nDid the Lord know what he was talking about? Should the people listen to the commandments, whether or not they realize just why they are given? Brethren, we as priesthood holders, members of his Church and kingdom here upon the earth—and I bear testimony that this is his Church and he directs it through a prophet of God—should keep the commandments.\nThe same article tells of a woman on the autopsy table and states: “Her scalp has been peeled back … and there is only a cavity where her brain once functioned.”\nIt also tells of a prominent lawyer in a large southern city who died of a heart problem caused by the smoking of cigarettes. It tells of the suicide of the dean of a community college who had blown off the top of his head when the agony of smoker’s emphysema had become too much to bear.\nThe article goes on to say that the use of nicotine and tobacco often leads to the use of heroin, other drugs, and alcohol. In the face of all these facts and this information, thousands and thousands of people continue to use cigarettes. This is another example of how important it is to listen to the Prophet of God and keep the commandments given through him. The Lord has said of his prophet:\n“Wherefore, meaning the church, thou shalt give heed unto all his words and commandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them, walking in all holiness before me;\n“For his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith.\n“For by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against you; yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you, and cause the heavens to shake for your good, and his name’s glory.” (D&C 21:4–6.)\nIs that promise enough, brethren?\nRegarding the Sabbath day, surely the members of the Church and priesthood holders will listen to the Lord when he commands us to keep the Sabbath day holy:\n“And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day;\n“For verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to pay thy devotions unto the Most High.” (D&C 59:9–10.)\nSurely we can give one day out of seven serving the Lord who came and gave his life for us. Surely we can follow the teachings of the Lord, where he says that we should do these things, worshipping him, expressing our gratitude and thanks for the sacrifice he has made. It seems that this commandment is being ignored and broken more often all the time by men who hold the priesthood.\nBrethren, in many, many areas it is time we take stock of ourselves and do what the Lord wants us to do. A man said to me the other day, not long ago, “This Church just demands too much of us.”\nI said, “Brother, this Church demands nothing of you. It just offers you a better way of life.” He said, “But it is awfully hard.” I said, “Let’s see if it is. Let’s go and get a cigar and have a good smoke. Let’s go and hold up a bank and see what happens. Let us go and join a group tonight as they go out on a big drunk.” He said, “President Tanner, don’t be ridiculous.” I said, “All right, I won’t if you won’t.” Then I said, “Just name one commandment that you think you shouldn’t keep, or you would advise your son not to keep.” He could not.\nRegarding our tithing, surely, brethren, we should be prepared to pay one-tenth of what the Lord has given us, especially when we realize that it could be taken away from us overnight with fire or hurricane, or any other thing that might take it away from us.\nWhen I was presiding over the Edmonton Branch a man came to me and said, “I can’t pay a full tithing this year. I have had to do some building, some remodeling, and so on.” I told him that the Lord had said that he would pour out blessings that we would hardly be able to contain. He said, “I still can’t do it.” Right after the first of the year that man spent several days in the hospital with a high doctor bill, and he paid it. I am not suggesting that he was there because he didn’t pay a full tithing, but I am suggesting that the evidence is there that he could have paid a full tithing.\nHow would you like the Lord to figure out his blessings on the same basis that you do when you are figuring out your tithing? If you were in deep trouble, had physical or mental illness, or your family were suffering and causing you much concern, would you want him to say, “Well now, just how much can I keep from giving him? How close can I figure this blessing?”\nBrethren, let us be obedient to the commandments of God. Let us prove faithful, let us be an example to the world, a light unto the world. Appreciate the priesthood which we have and the calling that is ours. We have been given the great privilege of holding the priesthood and the responsibility of taking the gospel to the world. We can do it by our actions as well as by precept, which is much more effective. Only as we live and keep the commandments of God, being obedient in all things can we fully enjoy life here and eternal life in the world to come, and be able to influence the world for good, and help build the kingdom of God here upon the earth.\nMay we do this, as members of the Church of Jesus Christ, which we are, and follow the prophet of God who has been chosen and through whom the Lord speaks, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "Those two beautiful songs, “All Hail the Power of Jesus’ Name,” and “Arise, Shine, Thy Light is Come,” together with that comprehensive prayer, have made me feel this morning to bear testimony to the world that I know that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the Living God, who came and gave his life for us. Though he gave us the plan of life and salvation, he was crucified. Through his resurrection it is possible for us to enjoy eternal life. Prophets of God have always been persecuted, and many of them killed when they taught the word of the Lord. What a serious situation to think of!\nAlso, I wish to bear my testimony to you today that his Church, with the gospel in its fulness, has been re-established through one of his chosen prophets; that the Church of Jesus Christ is here upon the earth today; and that Jesus is directing his Church through a living prophet, Harold B. Lee. I would appeal to men everywhere to listen to the word of the Lord as given unto us by the voice of his Prophet for the salvation of all mankind. Do not ignore, ridicule, or try to destroy.\nToday I should like to speak about the role of womanhood in this Church, where we have such a great body of wonderful women—wives, mothers, and single women engaged in the work of the Lord and in the service of their fellow men. They are affiliated with the Relief Society, the principal women’s organization; the Primary, where our children are instructed; the Sunday School, where the gospel is taught to all members; the MIA (Mutual Improvement Association), which is the activity and social organization for youth and adults; and our women serve with dedication and skill in various other capacities.\nAfter I had discussed business matters with some men the other day, the conversation took on a more personal, informal note when one man said: “I have the most wonderful wife in the world.” Another said: “That’s what you think. I think I have the best.” A third man said: “Isn’t it a great blessing to have a wife you love, who loves you, one who is a good mother and homemaker, with high ideals, who believes in God and wants to help her family accept and live the teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ?”\nWhat woman could want any greater glory or tribute than that which comes from an appreciative and loving husband? The applause and homage of the world fades into insignificance when compared with the approbation of God and expressions of love and appreciation which come from the hearts and lips of those who are nearest and dearest to her.\nFrom the beginning God has made it clear that woman is very special, and he has also very clearly defined her position, her duties, and her destiny in the divine plan. Paul said that man is the image and glory of God, and that woman is the glory of the man; also that the man is not without the woman, neither the woman without the man in the Lord. (See 1 Cor. 11:7, 11.) You will note that significantly God is mentioned in connection with this great partnership, and we must never forget that one of woman’s greatest privileges, blessings, and opportunities is to be a co-partner with God in bringing his spirit children into the world.\nIt is of great concern to all who understand this glorious concept that Satan and his cohorts are using scientific arguments and nefarious propaganda to lure women away from their primary responsibilities as wives, mothers, and homemakers. We hear so much about emancipation, independence, sexual liberation, birth control, abortion, and other insidious propaganda belittling the role of motherhood, all of which is Satan’s way of destroying woman, the home, and the family—the basic unit of society.\nSome effective tools include the use of radio, television, and magazines where pornography abounds and where women are being debased and disgracefully used as sex symbols—sex-ploited, some call it. Immodest dress, drugs, and alcohol daily take a tremendous toll through the destruction of virtue and chastity and even lives. With modern electronic devices of communication and speedy transportation, much more is being heard throughout the world by many more people than would be possible otherwise, and it is having its degrading influence and effect.\nYes, pornography, drugs, and alcohol are available to young and old in alarming quantity, and are destroying the moral values, and further deteriorating the minds and thought processes of those who succumb to these devilish wiles.\nPresident Dallin Oaks recently said to the student body at Brigham Young University: “We are surrounded by the promotional literature of illicit sexual relations on the printed page and on the screen. For your own good, avoid it. Pornographic or erotic stories and pictures are worse than filthy or polluted food. The body has defenses to rid itself of unwholesome food, but the brain won’t vomit back filth. Once recorded it will always remain subject to recall, flashing its perverted images across your mind, and drawing you away from the wholesome things in life.”\nIt is so important that our young girls keep themselves from this kind of pollution. The girls of today will be the women of tomorrow, and it is necessary that they prepare for that role. Can you imagine the kind of world we will have in the future if the girls of today are weakened morally to the extent that virtue will not be taught in their homes, and if their children, if any, are not nurtured within the walls of homes sanctified by the holy laws of matrimony?\nMarriage is ordained of God, and we must do everything we can to strengthen the ties that bind, to strengthen our homes, and to prepare ourselves by exemplary living to teach our children the ways of God, which is the only way for them to find happiness here and eternal life hereafter.\nAs we enumerate the many important responsibilities a woman has in connection with her duties as a wife, a mother, a homemaker, a sister, a sweetheart, or a good neighbor, it should be evident that these challenging responsibilities can satisfy her need to express her talents, her interests, her creativity, dedication, energy, and skill which so many seek to satisfy outside the home. It is impossible to estimate the lasting influence for good a woman can have in any of these roles. Let me remind us all of her primary responsibilities.\nFirst of all, as I mentioned before, she is a co-partner with God in bringing his spirit children into the world. What a glorious concept! No greater honor could be given. With this honor comes the tremendous responsibility of loving and caring for those children so they might learn their duty as citizens and what they must do to return to their Heavenly Father. They must be taught to understand the gospel of Jesus Christ and to accept and live his teachings. As they understand the purpose of life, why they are here and where they are going, they will have a reason for choosing the right and avoiding the temptations and buffetings of Satan, who is so very real and determined to destroy them.\nA mother has far greater influence on her children than anyone else, and she must realize that every word she speaks, every act, every response, her attitude, even her appearance and manner of dress affect the lives of her children and the whole family. It is while the child is in the home that he gains from his mother the attitudes, hopes, and beliefs that will determine the kind of life he will live, and the contribution he will make to society.\nPresident Brigham Young expressed the thought that mothers are the moving instruments in the hands of Providence and are the machinery that give zest to the whole man, and guide the destinies and lives of men and nations upon the earth. He further said, “Let mothers of any nation teach their children not to make war, and the children would not grow up and enter into it.” ( p. 199.)\nWhen the Lord God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet …”, he meant just that, and so presented Eve to Adam. (Gen. 2:18.) We are taught that a man should leave his father and mother, and cleave unto his wife, and that they should be one flesh, and thus is described the relationship that should exist between husband and wife. (Gen. 2:24.) It is said that behind every good man there is a good woman, and it is my experience and observation that this is generally true.\nIt is interesting to note that when executives of companies look for new employees, or are planning promotions for their experienced ones, they always want to know what kind of wife a man has. This seems to be very important. In the Church when men are being considered for new priesthood offices, the question is always raised about the worthiness of the wife and whether or not she can give him full support.\nWomen, you are of great strength and support to the men in your lives, and they sometimes need your help most when they are least deserving. A man can have no greater incentive, no greater hope, no greater strength than to know his mother, his sweetheart, or his wife has confidence in him and loves him. And men should strive every day to live worthy of that love and confidence.\nPresident Hugh B. Brown once said at a Relief Society conference: “There are people fond of saying that women are the weaker instruments, but I don’t believe it. Physically they may be, but spiritually, morally, religiously, and in faith, what man can match a woman who is really converted to the gospel! Women are more willing to make sacrifices than are men, more patient in suffering, more earnest in prayer. They are the peers and often superior to men in resilience, in goodness, in morality, and in faith.” (Relief Society Conference, Sept. 29, 1965.)\nAnd girls, don’t underestimate your influence on your brothers and your sweethearts. As you live worthy of their love and respect you can help greatly to determine that they will be clean and virtuous, successful and happy. Always remember that you can go much further on respect than on popularity. I was reading the other day of a report of a conversation between two young prisoners of war in Vietnam. One said: “I am sick of war, bombers, destruction, prison camps, and everything and everybody.”\n“I feel much like that myself,” said the other. “But there is a girl back home who is praying that I will come back. She cares, and it really helps me endure all these atrocities.”\nTo mothers, daughters, and women everywhere, let me stress the fact that because of your great potential and influence for good in the lives of all of us, Satan is determined to destroy you. You cannot compromise with him. You must have the courage, the strength, the desire, and the determination to live as the Lord would have you live—good clean lives. Girls, keep yourselves virtuous and worthy of a fine young man who has likewise kept himself clean, so that together you can go to the House of the Lord to be sealed in the holy bonds of matrimony for time and all eternity, and prepare a home where God will be pleased to send his spirit children. Then you will be able to face your children secure in the knowledge that your own example is the way to happiness and eternal progression. They are entitled to this heritage. I humbly pray that you will so live as to give it to them.\nThe whole purpose of the creation of the earth was to provide a dwelling place where the spirit children of God might come and be clothed in mortal bodies and, by keeping their second estate, prepare themselves for salvation and exaltation. The whole purpose of the mission of Jesus Christ was to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. The whole purpose of mothers and fathers should be to live worthy of this blessing and to assist God the Father and his son Jesus Christ in their work. No greater honor could be given to woman than to assist in this divine plan, and I wish to say without equivocation that a woman will find greater satisfaction and joy and make a greater contribution to mankind by being a wise and worthy mother raising good children than she could make in any other vocation.\nThe Lord has promised us great blessings if we will do our part in this divine plan. President Herbert Hoover gave this incentive: “If we could have but one generation of properly born, trained, educated and healthy children, a thousand other problems of government would vanish. We would assure ourselves of healthier minds, more vigorous bodies, to direct the energies of our nation to greater heights of achievement.” (Quoted by President David O. McKay, Conference Report, April 1931, pp. 79–80.)\nHow fortunate we are to have the Church of Jesus Christ established in these latter days, with a prophet of God upon the earth to receive divine revelation and direction for the children of men! We are blessed to know the personality of God, his attributes, and his characteristics. We have been given the plan of life and salvation. We are continually directed as to how we should live so we may have happiness here and eternal life hereafter. We have organizations set up to instruct and educate us in all matters pertaining to our temporal and spiritual welfare.\nOne of the finest programs the Church has instituted is what we call Family Home Evening, where all members of the family are called together once a week. It is quite thrilling to me when I contemplate that each Monday evening all over the Church throughout the world our families are gathered together in their homes, and the father, where possible, as head of the house, is directing his family in a discussion of all problems pertaining to their spiritual and temporal welfare, using a manual which has been carefully prepared and distributed to each family in the Church. Where these gatherings are held regularly and properly, they are of inestimable value to the family unit, as is evidenced by the many testimonies we receive. I wish to urge every family to follow this program, and I can promise you that as you do so you will be greatly blessed in unity, love, and devotion, and will be delighted with the outcome. Of course, family prayer should be a significant part of this evening, as well as regular family and individual prayer every day.\nI can think of nothing sweeter than a home where a man is living his religion, magnifying his priesthood, with his wife supporting him in every way, where love and harmony exists, and where together they are trying to raise a family of righteous sons and daughters whom they can take back into the presence of their Heavenly Father. This may sound like an impossible dream, but I can assure you that there are thousands of such families within the Church, and it is something that can be a reality for every one of us as we accept and live the teachings of Jesus Christ. How fortunate a child is to live in such a home, and how great will be the joy of the parents in their posterity!\nI repeat: Satan is trying to keep us from the full enjoyment which comes from keeping the commandments of God. We must never forget, and we must teach our children to know, that Satan is real and determined to destroy us. He knows the importance and significance of the family unit. He knows that entire civilizations have survived or disappeared depending on whether the family life was strong or weak. We can keep him out of our homes by living and teaching our children to live the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ, thereby resisting temptation when it comes, as it surely will.\nGirls, prepare yourselves to assume the roles of mothers by gaining knowledge and wisdom through a good education. We teach that the glory of God is intelligence, and so we must all be aware of what is going on around us and be prepared to thwart Satan in his attempts to divert us from our divine destiny. With knowledge, wisdom, determination, and the Spirit of the Lord to help us we can succeed.\nWe also believe that women should involve themselves in community affairs and in the auxiliary organizations of the Church, but always remember that home and children come first and must not be neglected. Children must be made to feel that mother loves them and is keenly interested in their welfare and everything they do. This cannot be turned over to someone else. Many experiments have been made and studies carried out which prove beyond doubt that a child who enjoys mother’s love and care progresses in every way much more rapidly than one who is left in institutions or with others where mother’s love is not available or expressed.\nFathers, too, must assume their proper role and responsibility. Children need both parents. While they are at home fathers should assume with mothers the duties attendant upon the young children, the discipline and training of the older ones, and be a listening ear for those who need to discuss their problems or want guidance and counseling. Through love establish a good relationship and line of communication with your children.\nI would urge all husbands, fathers, sons, and brothers to show our great respect and love and try to be worthy of the women who are our wives, mothers, daughters, sisters, and sweethearts. There is no surer way for a man to show his lack of character, of good breeding, and of quality than for him to show lack of respect for woman or to do anything that would discredit or degrade her. It is unchristianlike, unfair, and displeasing to God for any husband or father to assume the role of dictatorship and adopt the attitude that he is superior in any way to his wife.\nAt the Area Conference in Munich, Germany, President Lee said: “If you husbands remember that the most important of the Lord’s work you will ever do will be within the walls of your own home, you can maintain close family ties. … If you will strengthen your family ties and be mindful of your children, be sure that home is made a strong place in which children can come for the anchor they need in this day of trouble and turmoil, then love will abound and your joy will be increased.”\nAs women realize the importance of the home and family, and with their husbands keep the commandments of God to multiply and replenish the earth, to love the Lord and their neighbors as themselves, to teach their children to pray and to walk uprightly before him, then will their joy be increased and their blessings multiplied to the extent that they will hardly be able to contain them.\nThese blessings will be joy and rejoicing in our posterity of healthy, happy children, which blessings those who reject this way of life will never know. There will be peace and satisfaction in the accomplishments of children who succeed, and in turn make their own contribution to making this a better world for generations yet unborn. What a joyous privilege and blessing it will be for those families who, through obedience and love, have prepared themselves to go back into the presence of our Heavenly Father and have it said of each of them: “Well done, thou good and faithful servant … enter thou into the joy of thy lord.” (Matt. 25:21.)\nMay this be our privilege and blessing I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "Last evening in our priesthood meeting President Lee recalled some of the blessings that came from the recently completed great Munich conference. In my mind one of the highlights of this conference came in sharing the heartwarming statement and spirit of a beautiful young adult Latter-day Saint lady.\nShe was neatly dressed, with her head held just a little higher than would seem to be usual. Her eyes were still dropping meaningful tears following the soul-stirring closing Sunday afternoon session. In her best limited English—and incidently I don’t know now and I didn’t know then from which country she came, and it made no difference then, it makes no difference now except to say that she was one of us—as she shook my hand she said, “President Lee has lifted my soul to new heights. I feel I can now walk in strength beyond my own.”\nThis touching declaration reminded me of a similar quotation found in the book of Mark: “… Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.” (Mark 9:27.)\nCertainly the day is here when, if we are to follow in his paths, we must take the weary, lonely, depressed, the troubled soul, and the gospel-hungry by the hand and lift and help. Yes, we also need to lift the dishonest, the self-condemning, and those who have chosen expediency over correct principles. Countless numbers today will be able to take their first steps in the right direction when we are willing to provide the lift of confidence and encouragement and give them back that self-respect spoken of by President Lee in the opening session of this conference and to help others retain that self-respect.\n“For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.” (Matt. 25:35–36.)\nToday we can appropriately add, “I was down and ye lifted me up. My soul was sick and ye comforted me. My steps were unsteady and ye took my hand. I was uncertain and ye lifted me to paths of security.”\nHow beautiful in the eyes of the Lord are the spiritually well, those who have been taken by the hand and lifted up and made spiritually whole. How beautiful in the eyes of the Lord are those who take the time to lift the needy hand. Peace of mind only comes to us when we are spiritually healed. True joy comes from within. Freedom from a troubled soul is a worthy goal of all.\nMany were healed physically from ailments and suffering during the Savior’s ministry, but real joy and happiness were not always realized. People may be healed but not lifted. Happiness does not come from physical, social, or economic success. “… a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.” (Luke 12:15.)\nFrequently the Savior admonished the physically healed to boast not of their new strength, but rather to go their ways, walking in truth and using their new powers to lift others. Evidence teaches us many were healed physically but remained undisciplined and spiritually ill. “… return unto me, and repent of your sins, and be converted, that I may heal you” (3 Ne. 9:13), the Savior said.\nHealings are not to be made the subject of pride and boasting. Rather, healings should be used to lift self and others to greater heights and service. May we not appropriately conclude the lift can be more important than the healing.\nCertainly the greatest miracles of our day are the lifting and healing of troubled souls. Spiritual strength is a priceless possession available to those who will endure in righteousness. The healing of the troubled soul gives health and strength to those dead in things righteous. Purity, faith, hope, and charity are restored, making the once spiritually sick whole.\nThis healing comes through conversion to truth and adherence to correct principles. We have the scriptural promise that Christ “shall rise from the dead, with healing in his wings; and all those who shall believe on his name shall be saved in the kingdom of God. …” (2 Ne. 25:13.)\nSpiritual death and spiritual sickness vanish for those who would be healed by him and his atoning sacrifice.\nPresident Lee, in speaking recently to the priesthood, admonished them with: “In your hands is given a sacred trust not only to have the authority to act in the name of the Lord, but to so prepare yourselves as clean and pure vessels so that the power of Almighty God may be manifested through you as you officiate in the sacred ordinances of the priesthood.” Yes, in our hands is not only the power and authority to act, but the strength to lift if we remain true and faithful.\nBrothers and sisters, we must learn to look beyond the flesh and see the spirit, the soul, the attitude, the real human being.\nMay I share with you a recently published letter to “Dear Abby” that seems to clinch a point in this area of vision and values.\n“Dear Abby: Cold chills ran up my spine when I read the letter from the heartbroken mother, whose daughter, a nurse, was marrying an amputee. (He lost both his legs when he stepped on a mine in Vietnam.) The mother said her daughter was beautiful and could just as easily have married ‘a whole man.’ I am sure many people think my husband could have married ‘a whole woman’ instead of me. You see, when I was three I was shot with a .22 rifle. Thank God I am still alive, although my left side is paralyzed. I can walk and do most things other women can do. But best of all, a wonderful man thought I was ‘whole’ enough to marry. He is handsome, kind, and faithful, and he treats me like a queen. We’ve been happily married for ten years. I still can’t believe my good luck. Sign me, Freddy’s wife.”\n“Dear Freddy’s Wife: It’s more than ‘luck.’ You must have a lot going for you. Congratulations.”\nMay I add my congratulations to you, too, Abby, for taking someone by the hand and giving her a lift.\nIn this great Church we must try to lift those who need us economically, socially, physically, and spiritually as we earnestly link hands with the Lord in “this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.” (Moses 1:39.)\n“Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.\n“And a certain man lame from his mother’s womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;\n“Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.\n“And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.\n“And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.\n“Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.\n“And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ancle bones received strength.\n“And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.\n“And all the people saw him walking and praising God.” (Acts 3:1–9.)\nThis scripture is used for many purposes, to put over many points, but this morning I would just like to say that this man did not know he could walk until Peter took him by the hand and lifted him. He didn’t realize or believe he could now walk and go forth on his own. This initial lift started him on his way. Peter was able to lift him because he stood on high ground in God’s service.\nIn this area of thinking, lifting, and taking by the hand, it seems to me a scripture that is often misunderstood and one quoted by President Tanner so effectively earlier in this session is this:\n“Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.” (Gen. 2:24.)\nCertainly a now-married man should cleave unto his wife in faithfulness, protection, comfort, and total support, but in leaving father, mother, and other family members, it was never intended that they now be ignored, abandoned, shunned, or deserted. They are still family, a great source of strength, a refuge, a delight, and an eternal unit. Wise parents, whose children have left to start their own families, realize their family role still continues, not in a realm of domination, control, regulation, supervision, or imposition, but in love, concern, and encouragement.\nMany a full-time missionary has been heard to say, “I received some of my best letters while away, from a grandmother, an aunt, or a brother-in-law.” Others have said: “My father passed away some years ago, but my uncle or grandfather is keeping me financially in the mission field.” The whole family belongs to us and we to them. What a blessing. What a sacred obligation.\nJoseph Smith, the Prophet, valued this continuing source of strength. He on many occasions fervently prayed for the improved health of his ailing father so “that I might be blessed with his company and advice, esteeming it one of the greatest earthly blessings to be blessed with the society of parents, whose mature years and experience render them capable of administering the most wholesome advice.” ( vol. 2, p. 289.) Can we not appropriately say this morning and remind ourselves that though he were a prophet, yet learned he from the wisdom and love of a good family?\nJoseph once said of Hyrum: “There was Brother Hyrum who took me by the hand—a natural brother. Thought I to myself, Brother Hyrum, what a faithful heart you have got! Oh may the Eternal Jehovah crown eternal blessings upon your head, as a reward for the care you have had for my soul!” ( vol. 5, pp. 107–108.) “I could pray in my heart that all my brethren were like unto my beloved brother Hyrum, who possesses the mildness of a lamb, and the integrity of a Job, and in short, the meekness and humility of Christ; and I love him with that love that is stronger than death, for I never had occasion to rebuke him, nor he me.” ( vol. 2, p. 338.)\nOften the greatest lifts we receive come from within the ranks of our families. Sometimes the hands needed most are those closest to us. Often the hands closest to us are the strongest. When we begin to realize this relationship, one family member to another, we begin to understand the basics of our great welfare services programs which are the gospel of Jesus Christ in action. God has decreed family members are to help family members. God has decreed family members are to be a blessing to family members. When some of us in a discouraged frame of mind identify a family member as not worth a hand or a lift, may I remind us that when we continue to lift, regardless of the apparent results, added strength is ours. The more we lift, the more we are able to lift.\nWorthy Latter-day Saint marriages are forever, and as we cleave to the one most precious to us we are entitled to the blessings of the total family. The family lift will be available to us. We must take family members by the hand and show our love is real and continuing. When we take someone by the hand, both hands are left stronger. No one ever lifted someone else without stepping toward higher ground. We must make our home ties strong and available to all family members. Our homes should be places our children will want to come.\nIf we keep the commandments of God and walk hand in hand with him in his paths, Satan cannot touch us. Faithful members of the Church do not have to walk alone. The troubled soul need not find its way back alone. God’s hand is available to all if we will but reach out and up.\n“… Jesus took him [one possessed of a foul spirit] by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.\n“And when he [Jesus] was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?\n“And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.” (Mark 9:27–29.)\nI pray our Heavenly Father to help us so live that we may have that inner strength and power to take those about us by the hand and lift.\nI leave you my witness that God lives. This is the Church of Jesus Christ, restored in these latter days for the benefit of all mankind. President Harold B. Lee is a prophet of God. He, as witnessed by that beautiful young woman in Munich and thousands of others, has the God-given capacity to take us all by the hand and lift us to new heights if we will keep the commandments and follow his counsel. To this I declare and testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "I deem it a great honor and privilege to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We are met in his name and we act under his direction because this is his church, and we look to him as the only way—the truth and the light. In the words of a great prophet recorded in the Book of Mormon:\n“And moreover, I say unto you, that there shall be no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men, only in and through the name of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent.” (Mosiah 3:17.)\nFurther, he said we must humble ourselves “and become as little children, and believe that salvation was, and is, and is to come, in and through the atoning blood of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent.” (Mosiah 3:18.)\nWe are Christian. We want the whole world to know it. We look to Christ as the author and finisher of our faith, and he has not left us without direction for he has given us a living prophet and many revelations—revealing his will with respect to his church and kingdom on earth today.\nIn Section 42 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord sets forth the conditions for service in his kingdom. Beginning with verse 11, he says:\n“Again I say unto you, that it shall not be given to any one to go forth to preach my gospel, or to build up my church, except he be ordained by some one who has authority, and it is known to the church that he has authority and has been regularly ordained by the heads of the church.” (D&C 42:11.)\nThis indicates that the Lord will select those who are to act for him. No one is authorized to take this authority or honor to himself; rather, an authorized servant of the Lord will ordain them or set them apart to a specific assignment, and it will be known that the authorizing agent has such authority because he will have been regularly ordained to his position by the heads of the Church.\nThe Lord next proceeds to indicate what he expects his authorized ministers to teach:\n“And again, the elders, priests and teachers of this church shall teach the principles of my gospel, which are in the Bible and the Book of Mormon, in the which is the fulness of the gospel.” (D&C 42:12.)\nHere the Lord specifically spells out what he wants preached and taught—the principles of the gospel—and further what he wants his servants to use as source materials—the standard works of the Church. He did not mention the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price, possibly because they were not in existence in February of 1831 when this statement was received from the Lord.\nFrom this it is plain that we are not called to preach the philosophies of men mingled with scripture or our own ideas or the mysteries of the kingdom, nor are we called to bring forth new doctrine. The president of the Church will do that. But we are to stick to the basic fundamental principles of the gospel.\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith reemphasized this principle when he said:\n“After all that has been said, the greatest and most important duty is to preach the gospel.” ( p. 113.)\nPresident Joseph Fielding Smith reiterated this in his opening conference remarks in April of 1972 when he said:\n“To those who are called to positions of trust and responsibility in the Church we say: Preach the gospel in plainness and simplicity as it is found in the standard works of the Church. Testify of the truth of the work and the doctrines revealed anew in our day.” (“Counsel to the Saints and to the World,” July 1972, p. 28.)\nThis is a clear signal as to what the Lord would have taught by his servants today.\nThe Lord next gives some specifics as to the conduct he expects of his authorized ministers:\n“And they shall observe the covenants and church articles to do them. …” (D&C 42:13.)\nOnce again, these are very plain, clear instructions. He did not say it would be “nice” if we keep the commandments. He says “they shall observe the covenants and church articles to do them.” Surely obedience is the first law of heaven. We are given to understand that there will be no disobedience in the celestial kingdom. It is therefore vitally important that we keep the commandments with exactness and not just “almost.”\nThe account of the Lamanite striplings in the Book of Mormon as mentioned by Elder Monson is an excellent illustration of the blessings that flow from precise obedience. Helaman had formed them into an army of 2,060 young men who fought on the side of the Nephites, and when they were fighting for the Nephites, the Nephites could not lose.\nAt one time 200 of them were so badly wounded that they fainted from the loss of blood. When they were carried from the battlefield, it was thought they were dead, but they weren’t. They came back to life again—it seemed they could not be killed. What was their secret? It is recorded in Alma 57:21: “Yea, and they did obey and observe to perform every word of command with exactness. …”\nYes, they gave their mothers credit for teaching them, but they kept the commandments with exactness. This is the great secret. It is so important that we be in condition to serve the Lord, and condition comes only through obedience. To be a great leader, we must first be a great follower.\nThe revelation continues:\n“And they shall observe the covenants and church articles to do them, and these shall be their teachings, as they shall be directed by the Spirit.” (D&C 42:13.)\nHere the Lord stresses the fact that his servants must be led by his Spirit.\nBrigham Young’s counsel to missionaries going into the field was to the effect that he would: “rather hear an Elder … speak only five words accompanied by the power of God … than to hear long sermons without the Spirit.” ( p. 330.)\nIt is true that the Spirit giveth direction. It is the Spirit that carries conviction to the hearts of those who are honest.\nOur living prophet, President Harold B. Lee, made a significant statement on this subject and clearly illustrated the correct philosophy of a servant of the Lord. He did so shortly after he was ordained to the office.\nThe new First Presidency held a news conference in the administration building with many members of the press in attendance. One reporter asked President Lee if he would mind explaining what his goals were. He asked:\n“What do you expect to accomplish during your administration as president of the Church?”\nPresident Lee answered in his most characteristic way, substantially as follows:\n“Well,” he said, “I can only answer that question in the words of a great prophet when he was given an assignment by the Lord to secure an ancient record. He said:\n“‘And I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do.’” (1 Ne. 4:6.)\nBeing led by the Spirit is vitally important because this is the Lord’s church and he runs it. Those who are called to serve must let the Lord run his church. They must be led by his Spirit because man’s thoughts are not God’s thoughts and man’s ways are not God’s ways; therefore, for man to do God’s work he must have the Spirit of the Lord or he won’t know what to do or how to perform.\nTo continue with the revelation, now that the Lord has established the necessity for the Spirit, he proceeds to explain how to get the Spirit. The formula is apparently so simple:\n“And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach.” (D&C 42:14.)\nOn the surface it appears that all that is necessary to receive the Spirit is to ask for it, but it is not quite so easy a question! What is the difference between just ordinary prayer and a “prayer of faith”?\nAs we consider that question, the difference is immediately apparent. The difference is faith, and what is faith? Of course, there are many definitions of faith, but one definition is “a strong belief plus action.” It is not perfect knowledge (as Alma explains in Alma 32), but real faith lets a man act as if he knows it is true when he really doesn’t.\nTherefore, faith in a real sense is power—power to act and perform without actual knowledge. The Lord’s formula for receiving the Spirit, then, is to get on our knees and communicate with him. Tell him what we are going to do—make commitments with him—outline our program—and then get up off our knees and go and do precisely what we have told him we would do. In the doing, the Spirit comes.\nFrom the record, it is obvious that most home teachers do not really enjoy home teaching. I have been a home teacher for 21 years. I don’t think I have missed a half dozen visits over the whole period. I cannot say that I love to home teach until I get to the first home, and then I do love it because I then get the spirit of a home teacher because I am acting like a home teacher—doing what a home teacher does.\nIn order for a bishop to get the spirit of a bishop, he must first be called, ordained, and set apart, and that is in accord with the revelation we have just read. Does that give him the spirit of a bishop? Wouldn’t it be grand if it did? But of course it doesn’t. In order to get the spirit of a bishop, he must get on his knees and communicate with the Lord and then get up off his knees and go and do precisely what he has told the Lord he would do. Then he gets the spirit of a bishop as he acts like a bishop, and he is able to act for the Lord and do what the Lord would do if the Lord was the bishop.\nSuppose he gets up off his knees after telling the Lord he is going to conduct a priesthood executive committee meeting, and instead of conducting the committee meeting he goes fishing. Do you suppose he will get the spirit of a bishop? No, probably not, but rather he will likely get the spirit of a fisherman instead. And while the spirit of a fisherman is not altogether bad, it is not the spirit that he needs to conduct a priesthood executive committee meeting. If a man never acts like a bishop, even though he is called, ordained, and set apart so to be, he will never get the spirit of a bishop.\nIf a missionary never acts like a missionary, even though he is called and set apart so to be, he will never get the spirit of a missionary and thus will never really be a missionary, because without the Spirit he shall not teach, and a missionary that cannot teach is not a missionary. Likewise, a stake president who cannot teach is not a stake president. A home teacher who cannot teach is not a home teacher. An MIA president who cannot teach is not an MIA president.\nIs it any wonder that the Lord commands:\n“Wherefore, now let every man learn his duty, and to act in the office in which he is appointed, in all diligence.” (D&C 107:99.) Surely in the action, the Spirit comes as the Lord has promised.\nThere is one additional qualification that must be acquired in order to have success in the Lord’s work. We must love the people we are called to serve. Without this, all else is vain, because they will not accept our offering to them unless they know we love them.\nIn “The Vision of Sir Launfal,” an interesting story is told of a young knight who rode out into the world in search of the Holy Grail (the cup which the Master supposedly drank from at the Last Supper). He had dedicated his life to the quest. He was young, handsome, and strong, clothed in bright and shining armor, mounted on a gallant white charger. As he crossed the drawbridge riding out into the world, a beggar (who was a leper) put up his hand to him, begging alms. The young knight reached into his pouch, took out a gold coin and flung it to the beggar as he rode on, but he really did not give the beggar very much because no one would accept even a gold coin from a leper.\nThe young man searched for the cup; of course he didn’t find it, although he spent his life in the quest. He did, however, learn a lot, and at the close of his life he was returning to his castle, no longer young. He is now shrunken with age. His armor is no longer bright; his mount is no longer a charger but just a tired old gray horse. As he was about to cross the drawbridge into the castle, once again a beggar put up his hand begging for alms. This time Sir Launfal stopped, got down from his horse, reached into his knapsack and took out the only thing he had—a crust of bread. He then dipped his cup into the stream and gave the crust of bread and one cup of cold water to the beggar.\nThe wooden cup from which the beggar drank turned into the Holy Grail for which he had searched, and the beggar turned into a Christ and said a very interesting thing. He said:\n\n“Not what we give, but what we share.\nFor the gift without the giver is bare;\nWho gives himself with his alms feeds three,\nHimself, his hungering neighbor, and me.”\n\n(“The Vision of Sir Launfal,” James R. Lowell.)\n\nI long ago learned what all real missionaries must learn: “People do not really care how much you know until they know how much you care.” If you love them, they will listen to you; they will let you serve them.\nBecause the Lord Jesus Christ loved us, he died for us, and we accept his sacrifice in our behalf as the only way back to our Heavenly Father. May we be qualified to bear his name and may we have his spirit as we act in the office in which we are appointed in all diligence, but with love. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, the Redeemer. Amen."

        "year": 1973,
        "content": "A story is told in the Book of Mormon of 2,000 young men who responded to the call of their country to take up arms in its defense. Their leader’s name was Helaman. They became known as the sons of Helaman. We read of them in the book of Alma.\n“And they were all young men, and they were exceedingly valiant for courage, and also for strength and activity; but behold, this was not all—they were men who were true at all times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted.\n“Yea, they were men of truth and soberness, for they had been taught to keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before him.” (Alma 53:20–21.)\nThe lives of these exemplary young men are an inspiration to the youth of today. They displayed the traits of character needed so desperately today.\nAs I think of the sons of Helaman in relationship to our youth, I am impressed that many of the young men of this generation are endowed with the same traits of character as those of Helaman’s time, and that there is even more danger today.\nAt the present time, there are wars and rumors of wars. Yet, may I suggest that there is another war currently going on in the world—a war more destructive than any armed conflict—yes, a war between good and evil, between freedom and slavery, between the Savior and Satan. Satan’s legions are many. In their battle to enslave mankind, they use weapons such as selfishness; dishonesty; corruption; sexual impurity, be it adultery, fornication, or homosexuality; pornography; permissiveness; drugs; and many others. I believe Satan’s ultimate goal is to destroy the family, because if he would destroy the family, he will not just have won the battle; he will have won the war.\nNotwithstanding this influence among men, it is my conviction that a generation of youth is preparing for this battle as no generation has ever done before. I firmly believe the youth of today understand clearly, more clearly perhaps than their parents, the importance of the family. Just the other day a young lady said to me, and she was talking of so-called “responsible” parents as well as others, “Why can’t parents realize how important the family is?”\nMay I emphasize that when I refer to this generation I include girls and boys, for if a generation is to thrive in righteousness, and if family unity is to be preserved, the boys must have the same standards and nobility of character as the girls. There is no double standard in the eyes of God.\nIt is impressive and inspiring to see the many young men and young women of this generation who are endowed with the same traits of character as the 2,000 youth in Helaman’s time: traits of honesty, courage, willingness to serve, etc.\nTake for instance the 12- and 13-year-old deacons who raised money to buy lumber so they could build a doll house for a child in a fatherless home, or the young teenager who was addicted to drugs and sought the help of her Laurel class president, one of her peers. This president, through kindness, encouragement, and the work of other class members, helped this girl to freedom.\nThe examples are numerous. Some girls on their own initiative made a quilt for the baby of a blind couple. Another group of young people in one ward were concerned about the elderly and visited them, offering to run errands, etc. In this same ward one elderly couple reported that every time it snowed, some person whom they did not know cleared their driveway.\nA counselor in a bishopric who was responsible for the deacon-age youth lost his life in an accident. The deacons quorum president, 13 years old, immediately called a presidency meeting. As a presidency they called on the widow, assuring her that she need not be concerned about completing duties around the home or yard, but could count on all those duties being done.\nIn another case, a 12-year-old nonmember, motherless girl from an unfortunate environment was befriended by her peer group of Beehive girls and was made to feel welcome, wanted, and loved. Their adviser commented, “Many of the girls seemed more concerned about her happiness than about their own.”\nAnother class of teenage girls, upon learning of a physical disability of a neighbor, did her home canning for her. A group of young teenagers spent nine months writing, rehearsing, and preparing a readers theater—the subject by their own choice, “How Do I Know God Really Cares About Me?”\nProbably none of these activities would ever make the headlines; however, they are strong evidence that this generation of youth has the character to fight this battle against the forces of Satan.\nA few months ago something wonderful happened. The Lord through a prophet gave a revelation pertaining to this generation of youth such as has not been given to any other generation. The foundation of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is revelation—ancient and modern. Our message to the world is that God lives; the heavens are open; and he, the Lord, speaks through a living prophet, President Harold B. Lee. It was through this process that the Lord directed that the Aaronic Priesthood MIA organization be established. It was inaugurated in the Church on September 1 of this year. In the short time since then, reports indicate that exciting things are happening in the lives of youth as they begin to understand the significant and important principles involved in this change. These are:\nFirst, the programs and activities of youth between the ages of 12 and 18 have now come under the umbrella of the Aaronic Priesthood. In other words, the programs and activities for both boys and girls are now priesthood oriented. They have priesthood leadership which draws them closer than ever before to the very lifeline of the Church.\nSecond, it means involvement of youth to a degree never before experienced. The youth, with shadow leadership from adults, will plan and execute their own programs and activities.\nThird, the activities of youth will be service as well as activity oriented. This means personal service to others, not just games and parties.\nFourth, the entire effort of the Church is now individual boy and girl oriented—not program oriented. The welfare of the individual is the important factor.\nFifth, the Aaronic Priesthood MIA is committed to strengthening the family, recognizing it as the basic unit in society and the most important unit in all eternity.\nNow I should like to discuss in more detail some of these principles which are vital to the raising up of a generation of righteous, stalwart young men and women in these, the last days.\nWhat does it mean to be priesthood oriented? The priesthood is the power to act in the name of God. The young men who hold the priesthood are organized into quorums with a president and two counselors. In the case of the priests, the bishop is president assisted by a group leader. The presidency presides over the other young men of their same age. As a presidency they are concerned with the total well-being of each member of their quorum. If the president has been properly introduced to his responsibility in the quorum, he will know he has been called of God through inspiration. He will know the bishopric prayed about his call beforehand. What stronger motivating force could a young man have than to know he is called of God?\nTo illustrate, one deacons quorum president, missing one of his quorum members at meeting, called him on the telephone. The boy’s father, an elder, answered the phone. He was negative, not caring about his son’s activity. This deacons quorum president immediately called the elders quorum president and said in effect, “You’ve got a problem, and so have I.” He asked the elders quorum president to please labor with the father as he labored with the son and to report his progress.\nDo we catch the significance of peer leadership as well as the example of a young man being true at all times in whatsoever thing he was entrusted?\nHow about the girls? The bishop calls and appoints the class president of each age group. The president then chooses her counselors who are approved by the bishopric. These class presidencies also receive strength in knowing their callings have been inspired.\nA 17-year-old girl, going through the trauma of having only one parent in the home as well as the normal problems of adolescence, was called to be president of her Laurel class. Her response to this responsibility was, “I have never been so excited and thrilled about the Church in my life. I love it with all my heart and love every minute I have the privilege of serving.” Then she made another statement equally impressive. She said, “Since having received this call and having felt the responsibility, I have wanted to purify and refine my life so that I would be worthy of the call.”\nAnd yet another example of a young president. May I quote her adviser: “The other night when I took a few of the girls home after our meeting, the Beehive class president was the last girl in the car and wanted to talk about her new calling to be a youth leader. When the bishop visited with her about her responsibilities, he emphasized the importance of her being an example to her class members. As we talked, she mentioned that she had always attended church meetings and kept the commandments but was concerned that her family did not hold family home evening. She knew that she should be involved in family home evening if she were to be an example in all things. She talked to her father, but he was still reluctant to bring the family together on Monday nights. As an alternative, so that she would feel good about fulfilling her responsibilities to her peers, this 13-year-old girl had been reading the Book of Mormon each Monday night.”\nDo we as adults see the powerful, motivating force when young people realize the tie they have with the priesthood? No wonder exciting things are happening as the youth are allowed to lead out under the wise direction of adult leaders. The greatest and perhaps the most difficult adjustment will come to these adults who are now to be shadow leaders. They must have the patience and the sensitivity to stand in the shadows watching the youth grow and develop—a little painfully at times. Nevertheless, these leaders need to stand back and yet have the insight to know when the opportunity is right to take advantage of those choice teaching experiences which come occasionally, but come only once. I pray that adult leaders everywhere will work diligently to become this kind of shadow leader.\nEarlier we talked about the increased emphasis on service. Youth today want meaningful, spiritual experiences. They will have them through service to others, not the kind that causes great excitement, but the kind that is simple and plain and good.\nFrom what has been said I hope we all see the importance of the individual. Surely programs and activities are important, but they are important only as they influence for good the lives of individual boys and girls.\nFinally, the Aaronic Priesthood MIA is committed to strengthening the family. The Church in no way intends to take the place of the family. Its entire effort is to strengthen the family. Parents, the greatest responsibility you will ever have is the responsibility for your family. We plead with you: love your children. Be interested in them. Be an example to them. Teach them correct principles. Bless them with discipline when appropriate and afterwards show forth a greater measure of love. I believe with all my heart that our sons and daughters have all the potential of the sons of Helaman if we as parents with the support of the Church will do our part.\nMay I paraphrase from Alma:\n“And they are all young men and women, and they are exceedingly valiant for courage, and also for strength and activity; but behold this is not all, they are men and women who are true at all times in whatsoever thing they are entrusted.\n“Yea, they are men and women of truth and soberness for they have been taught to keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before him.”\nMay the Lord bless this royal generation that they may achieve that which he has foreordained for them, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "year": 1973,
        "content": "The Savior taught with many parables, and they are well known. But he also taught with pertinent and piercing questions. One of them was this: “… what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?” (Matt. 16:26.)\nThis is particularly important when we realize that the Lord defined eternal life as the greatest of all the gifts of God.\nEach one of us has a soul to save. Each has the opportunity to obtain eternal life. Since our souls are so precious, we should leave no stone unturned in our effort to save them.\nThe Savior illustrated this great fact with some of his best-known parables. For example, he said:\n“… The kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls; Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.” (Matt. 13:45–46.)\n“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he … goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.” (Matt. 13:44.)\nIn other words, he is telling us that salvation is the pearl of great price, salvation is the treasure in the field; and if we only realized its worth, we would give all that we have to obtain it.\nShall we not waken to this important lesson? It comes from the lips of God, who cannot lie.\nThe thing which is of most worth unto us is to be in the service of the Lord.\nThis means that we must not be blinded by the glitter of gold or the allurement of position or pleasure or even the false excitement of sin.\nWe must open our eyes to the fact that to serve God is the greatest career in the world.\nTo be saved in his presence is the greatest gift that can come to us, and to bring our family with us into the enjoyment of salvation will be the greatest achievement of our lives.\nBut we must understand that salvation is not a free gift. The offer is free indeed, through the atonement of the Savior. But its enjoyment must be earned, not with any halfhearted effort, but with wholesouled, undivided, concentrated application to a program of development which is called the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.\nIf we believe in immortality at all, we must also believe in God. And if we believe in him, we should accept the fact that it is possible for us to become like him. Actually, this is what God expects of us.\nHe gave us his Beloved Son Jesus Christ as a pattern to live by, and through him we can become perfect, even as God.\nWhat a marvelous destiny! What an opportunity!\nIs it any wonder that the scripture calls it the pearl of great price?\nThen should we not make every effort to achieve it? But on the other hand, if we do not, what are we exchanging for our souls?\nThe Savior told us that in his house are many mansions. The apostle Paul gave us the further detail that in the world to come there are various degrees of glory. We will be assigned to them on a basis of our worthiness. We will be judged according to our works.\nThe rewards on the day of judgment will differ as one star differs from another star in glory. Paul said also that beyond the glory of the stars is another glory which he likened to the brightness of the moon, in contrast to the stars.\nAnd still another is mentioned by him—the celestial glory—which is as superior to the others as the light of the sun outshines that of both the moon and the stars.\nIn modern revelation we are told that only those who are devoted to God and his way of life will reach the celestial glory. Only those who go there may become like him.\nAll others, going to the lesser glories, will be restricted in that they may not become like him.\nI ask you here today—where do you want to spend eternity? Where would you like your family to spend eternity?\nIf you knew that by living the gospel you may have celestial glory rather than a lesser one, would it not be worth the effort to obtain it?\nWho would be satisfied with the subdued twinkle of a star if he could enjoy the brilliance of the sun?\nWho would be content with the reflected light of the moon if he could have the radiance of the sun?\nWho would exchange the privilege of becoming like God for the very questionable and temporary advantages of this world?\nWho in his right mind would prefer the corruptions of the flesh, the sensual pleasures, and the false excitement of sin, rather than the opportunity of becoming like God; rather than having inspired intelligence, or of some day wielding some of the powers that God uses as he walks in his majesty?\nWhich of us would sell his birthright for a mess of pottage?\nIsn’t it advisable that we direct to our own selves the question raised by the Savior: “… what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?”\nWhether we realize it or not, we answer that question every day of our lives by what we think and say and do. Our actions demonstrate whether we are working toward becoming like God or the world.\nWhat will a man give in exchange for his soul?\nWhat will a woman give in exchange for her soul?\nWhat will parents barter for the souls of their little children, these tiny ones, who are given into their care by the Almighty himself, to whom they should teach the principles of righteousness, and whom these parents should lead into the proper pathways of life?\nAre there any parents who are willing to trade their children’s future for a mess of pottage to be consumed greedily by themselves? Dare they sacrifice the welfare of their little ones to gratify their own self-centered interests?\nChild neglect! How widespread it is!\nWhat is the value of a child’s soul?\nWhat is any soul worth?\nWould you exchange it for a thrill? Would you exchange it for advantage in business? Would you exchange it for social life, or for emancipation from home and family in a woman’s liberation movement? Would you exchange it for any amount of money? What is your rate of exchange?\nWhether we realize it or not, we are making this very kind of bargain if we prefer worldly things over our religion.\nThe only way to save our souls is to put God first in our lives.\nIf we reverse the process and relegate him to second, third, or fourth place, we make an exchange that we will rue throughout the eternities. It is possible to lose our salvation by default.\nRealizing this, can we afford to be other than active in the Church? Can we afford to neglect our families? Can we afford to mix worldliness and Godliness, knowing very well that they will not blend and knowing, too, that Jesus said we cannot serve both God and mammon?\nThe Lord teaches that unless we are valiant in his service, we surrender the opportunity for celestial glory. To be valiant means to be anxiously engaged in the good cause. It means to serve him in all diligence, with an eye single to his glory, and to labor in his kingdom with all our heart, might, mind, and strength.\nBut it must be in his kingdom, not in some other group, religious or otherwise.\nSo what will we exchange for our soul? Will it be worldly advantage, or money, or pleasure, or the corruption of sin, thinking that wickedness gives enough thrill to compensate for all its miseries?\nWhat will a man give in exchange for his soul?\nFathers and mothers, are you listening? Are you listening to the Savior calling to you and your little ones?\nDo you hear his words: “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” (Matt. 11:28–30.)\n\nAnd hear these words, too, from your Savior and your Redeemer:\n“… inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents.\n“For this shall be a law unto the inhabitants of Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized.\n“And their children shall be baptized for the remission of their sins when eight years old, and receive the laying on of the hands.\n“And they shall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord.” (D&C 68:25–28.)\nAre we doing all of this, parents, or are we making an exchange that we will later regret?\nCan you hear the words of the Savior, speaking by modern revelation and saying: “… thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy might, mind, and strength; and in the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt serve him.” (D&C 59:5.)\nAre we doing this, or are we making an exchange for something else?\nDo you hear him say, “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself …”? (D&C 59:6.)\nDo you obey?\nAnd do you hear him say, “… thou shalt not steal; neither commit adultery, nor kill, nor do anything like unto it”? (D&C 59:5.)\nDo you comply? Or do you put aside his words in exchange for your personal desires? Do you suppose for one minute that you can separate the salvation of your soul from obedience to the gospel?\nOne of the greatest of all the commandments is the Golden Rule. Do we do unto others as we would be done by? And if not, what kind of exchange do we make?\nWhat shall we say of those who cheat a little newsboy out of his collections? What kind of bargain do they make?\nAnd what shall we say of those who refuse to pay their doctor bills or hospital bills, but in their hypocrisy go to Church on Sunday and sing praises to the Lord?\nAnd then comes this appeal of the Savior:\n“… the inhabitants of Zion shall also observe the Sabbath Day to keep it holy.” (D&C 68:29.)\n“And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day.” (D&C 59:9.)\nHow many meet this requirement? It is a commandment from heaven, given to each of us. If we fail to keep it, do we tend to exchange our soul’s welfare for worldly things such as Sunday business, Sunday pleasure, and weekend vacations?\nWhat will a man give in exchange for his soul?\nWe should realize that the Lord means just what he says in dealing with us. He offers us the riches of eternity; and while we are in mortality, he offers us an abundant life, with peace of mind, true happiness, and freedom from the enslaving influences of sin.\nBut this can come only through obedience. And why obedience? Because he desires that we become like him—because we are his children—and because we cannot achieve perfection by imperfect means.\nTo become Christlike we must do the works of Christ.\nThe Lord does not take any free agency away from us in giving us this commandment. He gives us unlimited and unrestricted freedom of choice.\nBut he makes it abundantly clear that if we do not serve him, we shall not receive his reward.\nMere membership in the Church will not save us. The revelation says:\n“… he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward.\n“Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause. …\n“… he that doeth not anything until he is commanded, and receiveth a commandment with doubtful heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness, the same is damned.” (D&C 58:26–27, 29.)\nAnd again: “He that receiveth my law and doeth it, the same is my disciple; and he that saith he receiveth it and doeth it not, the same is not my disciple, and shall be cast out. …” (D&C 41:5.)\nSo you see, what we do or fail to do determines our status before him.\nIt is not Church membership alone that he asks. Nor is it reading the scriptures alone, nor paying tithing alone. It is wholehearted obedience and faithfulness of heart that counts.\nThe choice is placed before us—worldliness or salvation. Which shall it be? There is no middle ground in this matter. Lukewarm obedience is spurned by the Lord. What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\nThe Savior asked another pertinent question:\n“… what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? …” (Matt. 16:26.)\nIt must needs be that there is an opposition in all things.\nIt must needs be that we have complete freedom of choice.\nBut knowing the facts, will we exchange the divine blessings of both here and hereafter for the questionable things of this world? Is it really conceivable that we would choose darkness rather than light, or sorrow rather than joy?\nYet this is what we do if we turn away from active service in the Church. This is the exchange we make.\nLet us never forget that the Lord has promised that if we seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, all that he has may be ours.\nAnd this is my testimony to you, in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "Beloved brothers and sisters:\nAgain we meet in a glorious conference.\nIn the sessions of this impressive conference we have had exhortation, instructions, and warning. The sermons were each mighty and sobering. We were instructed quite fully in the ways of the Lord. Very prominent in the sermons were the words like this: Walk uprightly. Keep my commandments. Live my laws. We were reminded about marriage—proper marriage—about repentance and forgiveness, about building self-esteem, and walking in the ways of righteousness. We have heard of the “troubled seas” and that “wickedness is never happiness.”\nA story is written by Roy H. Stetler, publisher of a religious journal in the East:\n“It occurred outside the Crimean Castle of Livadia. The castle was aglow with lights. A soldier was pacing in carefully measured steps back and forth, guarding the castle, which, at the moment, housed within its walls a most momentous conference of world men. The soldier appeared proud of his task, for what soldier would not like to tell his children, and grandchildren, that he had once done guard duty for the momentous meeting of the ‘Big Three.’\n“Suddenly, out of the darkness, like a phantom, a figure appeared on the path that led to the entrance of the castle. As the figure approached, the guard commanded, ‘Halt! Who goes there? Come hither and make yourself known!’ And with that the guard quickly took his gun from his shoulder and poised it for any emergency.\n“The stranger spoke. ‘I wish to meet with the men who are in the castle.’\n“‘Preposterous!’ exclaimed the guard. ‘You cannot enter the castle. Do you not know that the “Big Three” are meeting to decide the course of the whole world? No one is permitted to enter.’\n\nThe man replied, ‘You say it is the “Big Three”? Why are they called the “Big Three”?’\n“‘They are they,’ said the guard, ‘who shall say how this world shall be ruled.’\n“The stranger looked intensely at the guard. His eyes flashed as he said, ‘That is why I must be with them, because I can help them. I have a plan that will really work, and will keep the peace of the world, if they will only adopt my plan.’\n“The soldier laughed. ‘Go on your way, man; you have no credentials.’\n“The man replied, ‘Credentials? Perhaps not—here.’ And he raised his hand in salute as he left. The guard saw an ugly scar in his hand. Then he looked at the other hand, and it, too, had a scar.\n“‘You were in battle?’ he asked, a little more gently. ‘I see wounds in your hands.’\n“The stranger turned again. ‘No, I did not think you would notice,’ he replied. ‘No, I did not receive these wounds in battle.’ With that, he disappeared suddenly, as if the darkness had enveloped him.\n“The guard looked after him, and marveled. ‘I should have known!’ he exclaimed. ‘If only I had let him in!’ And he slumped to the ground in dismay.”\nThis was he who brought blessings to all the inhabitants of the earth. This was he who spoke of those who would ask the stranger this question:\n“What are these wounds in thine hands and in thy feet? Then shall they know that I am the Lord; for I will say unto them: These wounds are the wounds with which I was wounded in the house of my friends. I am he who was lifted up. I am Jesus that was crucified. I am the Son of God.” (D&C 45:51–52.)\nAnd remembering that life is a time of rewards and punishments, may we consider the positive side today for a while, the rewards which come from him for obedience.\n“And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.\n“And he said unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.\n“And they straightway left their nets and followed him.” (Matt. 4:18–20.)\nAnd two others, James and John, the sons of Zebedee, followed him.\nAnd two sets of brothers became apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ.\nAnd I assure you that is one of the greatest blessings of all blessings that can come to any man, and honor, too. Exactly 30 years ago today, October 7, 1943, almost to the hour, I knelt at the feet of President Heber J. Grant and I was ordained an apostle of Jesus Christ.\nIn the 76th revelation called The Vision, blessings are promised:\n“That by keeping the commandments they might be washed and cleansed from all their sins, and receive the Holy Spirit by the laying on of the hands of him who is ordained and sealed unto this power;\n“And who overcome by faith, and are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, which the Father sheds forth upon all those who are just and true.\n“They are they who are the church of the Firstborn.\n“They are they into whose hands the Father has given all things—\n“They are they who are priests and kings, who have received of his fulness, and of his glory;\n“And are priests of the Most High, after the order of Melchizedek, which was after the order of Enoch, which was after the order of the Only Begotten Son.\n“Wherefore, as it is written, they are gods, even the sons of God—\n“Wherefore, all things are theirs, whether life or death, or things present, or things to come, all are theirs and they are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.\n“And they shall overcome all things.” (D&C 76:52–60.)\n“These shall dwell in the presence of God and his Christ forever and ever.\n“These are they who shall come forth in the resurrection of the just.\n“These are they who are just men made perfect through Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, who wrought out this perfect atonement through the shedding of his own blood.” (D&C 76:62, 65, 69.)\n“Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing …\n“And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee. …” (Matt. 4:23, 25), and other places,\n“And seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain … his disciples came unto him: And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:\n“Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n“Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.\n“Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.\n“Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.\n“Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.\n“Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.\n“Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.\n“Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n“Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.\n“Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven. …” (Matt. 5:1–12.)\nIt seems that Jesus’ heart was always filled with blessings.\nAs the Prophet Joseph records:\n“And thus we saw the glory of the celestial, which excels in all things—where God, even the Father, reigns upon his throne forever and ever;\n“Before whose throne all things bow in humble reverence, and give him glory forever and ever.” (D&C 76:92–93.)\n“And the glory of the celestial is one, even as the glory of the sun is one.” (D&C 76:96.)\nAnd again:\n“But great and marvelous are the works of the Lord, and the mysteries of his kingdom which he showed unto us, which surpass all understanding in glory, and in might, and in dominion.” (D&C 76:114.)\n“Neither is man capable to make them known, for they are only to be seen and understood by the power of the Holy Spirit, which God bestows on those who love him, and purify themselves before him;\n“To whom he grants this privilege of seeing and knowing for themselves.” (D&C 76:116, 117.)\nThe revelation of 1832, known as The Vision, begins thus:\n“Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, and rejoice ye inhabitants thereof, for the Lord is God, and beside him there is no Savior.\n“Great is his wisdom, marvelous are his ways, and the extent of his doings none can find out.\n“His purposes fail not, neither are there any who can stay his hand.\n“From eternity to eternity he is the same, and his years never fail.\n“For thus saith the Lord—I, the Lord, am merciful and gracious unto those who fear me, and delight to honor those who serve me in righteousness and in truth unto the end.\n“Great shall be their reward and eternal shall be their glory.” (D&C 76:1–6.)\nAnd when he gives a blessing, he fulfills it; when he makes a promise, it comes to pass. In 1831 the Lord said:\n“What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.” (D&C 1:38.)\nThe message of the Lord was love and peace.\nAs the Lord began to prepare his apostles for his crucifixion, he said, “He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.” (John 14:12.)\nAnd we remember the story of Abraham, when three persons came to him in the Plains of Mamre, and Abraham bowed himself to the ground. They asked, “Where is Sarah, thy wife?” and continued:\n“Lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.\n“Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.\n“Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?\n“And the Lord said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?\n“Is any thing too hard for the Lord? … Sarah shall have a son.” (Gen. 18:9–14.)\nCertainly nothing is impossible with the Lord. His promises are fulfilled.\nIn 1833 the Lord made promises which we should never take lightly:\nHe said, “… the destroying angel shall pass by them … and not slay them,” bringing back to our memory the days of Egypt.\nThey shall have good health, he said, and strength and power with marrow in their bones and health in their navel.\nAnd perhaps even greater promises than those: “And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures.” (See D&C 89:18–21.)\nAll these blessings to all of us who remember the sayings and walk in obedience.\n“If ye love me, keep my commandments,” he told his people constantly. (John 14:15.)\nThere are depths in the sea which the storms that lash the surface into fury never reach. They who reach down into the depths of life where, in the stillness, the voice of God is heard, have the stabilizing power which carries them poised and serene through the hurricane of difficulties.\nThere are so many beautiful promises. To read the scriptures and turn the pages, and it seems that it is almost all rewards, evidence of living the commandments of the Lord.\nAnd another solemn promise came from the Lord:\n“And [he that liveth in righteousness] shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye. …” (D&C 101:31.)\n“Hearken ye to these words. Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world. Treasure these things up in your hearts, and let the solemnities of eternity rest upon your minds.\n“Be sober. Keep all my commandments.” (D&C 43:34, 35.)\nAnother blessing promised:\n“For in mine own due time will I come upon the earth in judgment, and my people shall be redeemed and shall reign with me on earth.” (D&C 43:29.)\nFrom the Psalms we have this promised blessing. He said:\n“The earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. …\n“Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place?\n“He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; … He shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.” (Ps. 24:1–5.)\nThen in our own dispensation comes this great reward:\n“For all who will have a blessing at my hands shall abide the law which was appointed for that blessing.” (D&C 132:5.)\nThen he speaks about the blessings of eternity. He said of those who keep the commandments and live worthily:\n“… and they shall pass by the angels, and the gods which are set there, to their exaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever.\n“Then shall they be gods, because they have no end … then shall they be gods, because they have all power, and the angels are subject unto them …\n“… if ye receive me in the world, then shall ye know me, and shall receive your exaltation; that where I am ye shall be also.” (D&C 132:19, 20, 23.)\nTo the children of Israel he spoke. He promises this to us today.\n“For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.\n“And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.\n“And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.\n“And I will walk among you, and be your God, and ye shall be my people.” (Lev. 26:9–12.)\nAnd as he left them, he promised:\n“Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.” (John 14:27.)\nAll this—what more could be desired or asked for? All these blessings and numerous others to every one of us who is willing to live the commandments and be truthful and honorable in our dealings.\nI bear witness that God has given us conditionally all these and thousands of other good things. He has organized his true church upon the earth. This is his church. He has given us the total program which will carry us forward toward perfection; and he has given us prophets to lead and guide us. And President Harold B. Lee today is the leader of this kingdom and this people, and he is a prophet of God. This I know. To this I bear solemn witness in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "My Church assignments require me to do considerable traveling throughout the world. When I arrive in a city, a stake president or one of his counselors usually meets me at the airport. Although seldom if ever have I met him before, I can invariably find him among the crowd of watchers at the gate and can walk up to him and greet him. He can also recognize me among the crowd of deplaning passengers. A certain amount of publicity is associated with our work as General Authorities. Our pictures appear in various magazines and news articles, so I can explain how he can recognize me from having seen my picture. But how is it that I can so readily recognize him?\nJust this January, Sister Burton and I were walking along a street in Rio de Janeiro, when I saw a man walk past us who appeared as though he would make a good Mormon. I thought to myself, “If I could only speak Portuguese, there would be a fine missionary contact.” He stopped ahead of us to look in a shop window and as he did so, he turned facing us. When he saw us he waited until we came up to him and then spoke to us in English. We returned his greeting and he asked us if we were Americans. We replied in the affirmative and he asked, “Are you perchance Mormons?” I replied, “Yes. What do you know about the Mormons?” He told us he was a Mormon also and we had a lovely visit with him. We learned he was a bishop’s counselor in one of the Rio Wards. We met him again in a conference session, along with other wonderful Latter-day Saints who lived in that beautiful city. How was it that we could recognize one another among the teeming thousands of people walking along that busy street?\nA question asked by one of the ancient prophets in the Book of Mormon gives an answer. He was talking to church members when he said:\n“And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye received this mighty change in your hearts?” (Alma 5:14.)\nWhat a challenging question not only to them, but to us also! If we truly accept God in our lives and live in accordance with his commandments, God will work a mighty change in our appearance and we will begin to appear more like our Heavenly Father, in whose image we have been created. Could it be this appearance we recognize when we meet men and women who are trying to live close to the Lord?\nThe prophet then goes on to say this about the final day of judgment which someday each one of us must face:\n“I say unto you, can ye look up to God at that day with a pure heart and clean hands? I say unto you, can you look up, having the image of God engraven upon your countenances?” (Alma 5:19.)\nI dare not say that Mormons are perfect, for you know as well as I do that we each have many human faults. We do, however, call ourselves saints as did the members of the Church of Jesus Christ in the days of the original apostles. When those apostles wrote letters to the members of the Church they addressed them as saints. A saint is not necessarily a person who is perfect, but he is a person who strives for perfection—one who tries to overcome those faults and failings which take him away from God. A true saint will seek to change his manner of living to conform more closely to the ways of the Lord.\nIt is true that we each have imperfections to overcome. Life is a constant series of challenges and trials. Notwithstanding, we should never fail to strive for that perfection of life which can bring us closer into harmony with God. As the apostle Paul said in writing to the Philippians:\n“I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Let us therefore, as many as [would] be [come] perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.” (Philip. 3:14–15.)\nThus we should seek to overcome any discovered fault in our characters which tends to take us away from a total commitment to God.\nI would like to speak about that principle of dedication or total commitment. It appears to me that when we join the Church of Jesus Christ and especially when we receive the oath and covenant of the priesthood, we should commit ourselves wholly and completely to the cause of God. By this I do not mean we need give up our daily occupations or our interests in the daily affairs of mankind unless we are called by authority from God to do so. I do mean that a true change must occur in our thinking so complete and so total that our very lives are changed for the better as far as our attitudes and our actions are concerned.\nA person’s attitude is perhaps the hardest of all personal attributes to change. If your attitude is right, then your life is made right. If your heart is touched, your mind and way of thinking will change and your life will change for the better accordingly. I believe we must become so immersed in the gospel of Jesus Christ that we become physically as well as mentally more and more like the Lord himself. We must yield our whole hearts to him. What we then do is done not because we are asked to, nor because we are forced to, but because we want to. Neither pressure nor force can be exerted upon us from outside, when what we do is done because it is our own choice and desire. It then makes no difference to us what other men may think, or say, or do. Our hearts being committed wholly to God, what we do is done out of our love for and our trust in him. We then serve God in every way we can because we have been converted, our attitude has been changed and we now desire to become like him both spiritually and physically.\nIf we believe in Jesus Christ that completely, then we can say as did the people of King Benjamin that we know of a surety of the truth of the gospel:\n“… because of the Spirit of the Lord God Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.” (Mosiah 5:2.)\nWhen I speak then of total commitment, I do not refer to a momentary dedication which comes from being filled with the Spirit of God only on certain occasions such as in this conference. I refer to a daily or continuing spirit of devotion and dedication which comes from keeping all the commandments of God every day. We must not pick and choose which commandment of God we will or will not obey. Every one is important. For example, we cannot postpone genealogical research, temple work, or missionary work until after we retire. When we accept Jesus Christ, we accept his apostles and prophets and his total concept of Christian living. We then gladly accept the admonition of God’s servants and willingly have family prayer, hold family home evening, keep a year’s supply of food on hand for emergencies, send our sons and daughters on missions, keep the fast, pay an honest tithe, care for the poor and the needy, and are kind and thoughtful and considerate of others. We willingly become saviors for our families and go to the temple regularly to officiate in behalf of our kindred dead who have sacrificed so much for us.\nWhen we therefore understand this principle of commitment, we will realize the importance of priesthood genealogy and temple work. The Lord said that unless the hearts of the fathers are turned to their children and unless the hearts of the children are turned to their fathers, this earth life would fail its purpose. Genealogical work is therefore important and we should get on with it. Yet it will succeed no faster than the bishops in the individual wards give leadership to this program. It will succeed no faster than stake presidents in their individual stakes become actively involved in priesthood genealogical work. There are those who say that they are too busy to give leadership to this program, but I believe such persons fail to understand that it is a basic priesthood program given us by God. Will God’s work fail in its purpose? Is anything too difficult for God? The answer we all know. God’s purposes will be fulfilled by those servants he has chosen to lead out in this work. It is this total commitment, this dedication of purpose, this unfailing faith in God’s work that I am referring to, not only in this, but in all priesthood programs.\nFrom the following scripture, it is clear that the admonition to become totally committed to the cause of Jesus Christ is important to all, especially to those who regard themselves as members of the Church of Jesus Christ in good standing:\n“And we know also, that sanctification through the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is just and true, to all those who love and serve God with all their mights, minds and strength.\n“But there is a possibility that man may fall from grace and depart from the living God;\n“Therefore let the church take heed and pray always, lest they fall into temptation;\n“Yea, and even let those who are sanctified take heed also.” (D&C 20:31–34.)\nAs I understand this scripture, it means that Jesus Christ is kind and merciful to us when we serve him with our whole hearts, but not any of us can take refuge in past righteousness or service. It also means that there is a possibility that any one of us can fall out of good standing, even those who have already achieved a certain degree of righteousness. Therefore, we need to be on our constant guard, each of us, that we not allow ourselves to fall into habits of carelessness in our faith, in our prayers, or in our various Church activities or responsibilities. It is for this reason that I am resolving again to live closer to God each day and to follow his chosen prophets and apostles more diligently than I have ever done in the past.\nAs the coming of the Lord approaches, Satan’s pressure on us will increase. We will thus have to live closer to the Lord than we have ever done before. I resolve to do this for I know that God lives. I know that Jesus Christ is his Only Begotten Son, and that these brethren who we sustain as our leaders are true apostles and prophets. They have been called and ordained of God to lead us back into his very presence. I invite all of you who hear my voice or who read this message to take heed as the scriptures have indicated, and that you rededicate yourselves in a total commitment to serve the Lord with all your heart, might, mind, and strength. I so pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "The Lord’s thoughts and ways are higher than the thoughts and ways that come from men.\nThe Lord said to man: “… my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, … for as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.” (Isa. 55:8–9.)\nGod’s way was to create man, male and female, in his own image and likeness.\nMan’s way is that man came from a lower form of life. God’s way justifies self-respect.\nGod’s way provides man a divine way of life. The Lord promised his children salvation in the kingdom of God if they would live and follow his ways. It is important to know that man can become godlike through the thoughts and ways of the Lord.\nThe Lord’s way was to send a savior who would live and teach the ways of a living God. “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.” (John 3:16–17.)\nJesus Christ said, “… I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.” (John 6:38.)\n“And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life. …” (John 6:40.)\n“… the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.” (John 5:19.)\n“… all men should honour the Son,” he said, “even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him. … He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.” (John 5:23–24.)\nGod has provided one way and only one way for his mortal children to attain godlike perfection. Jesus Christ proclaimed, “I am the way, the truth, and the life: No man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” (John 14:6.)\nJesus Christ brought to this earth from heaven the Lord’s ways and the Lord’s truths.\nJesus Christ lived and exemplified the heavenly life, that the Father desires all of his children to live.\n“… I am come,” Jesus said, “that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.” (John 10:10.)\nThe full, abundant, divine way of life can be gained by following and walking in the light of Jesus Christ.\n“… I am the light of the world”; Jesus said, “he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.” (John 8:12.)\n“That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day.” (D&C 50:24.)\nBy following the Son of God and by living worthy to receive the light of life we can take on the radiance of godliness. Not only can we be children of God, in his image and likeness, but we can be sons and daughters of God in this life and in the kingdom of heaven.\nWe have this promise from the Savior: “Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I am the life and light of the world. … verily, I say unto you, that as many as receive me, to them will I give power to become the sons of God. …” (D&C 11:28, 30.)\nGod’s greatest gift to his children is for them to be saved in the kingdom of God. The Lord said, “If thou wilt do good, yea, and hold out faithful to the end, thou shalt be saved in the kingdom of God, … for there is no gift greater than the gift of salvation.” (D&C 6:13.) This is the gift of all gifts; this is the diploma of all diplomas. This is the degree in salvation that qualifies one for eternal life in the kingdom of God.\nJesus taught that few would find the way to salvation. He commanded his disciples to follow the Lord’s way.\nHe said, “Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.” (Matt. 7:13–14.)\nYes, our Heavenly Father so loved us that he sent his only begotten Son down from heaven to this earth that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life, but few find the divine way. Only a few will follow Jesus Christ. Only a few will love God first. Only a few will keep God’s commandments. Because they love the lower thoughts and ways of men more than they love the higher thoughts and ways of God. “And this is the condemnation,” Jesus said, “that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil.” (John 3:19.)\nAnd again we read from the scriptures:\n“For you shall live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God.\n“For the word of the Lord is truth, and whatsoever is truth is light, and whatsoever is light is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ.\n“And the Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; and the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit.\n“And every one that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit cometh unto God, even the Father.” (D&C 84:44–47.)\nThe voice of the Lord continues, “And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things.” (D&C 88:67.) What a glorious promise!\nThe light of the Savior is available to everyone who will follow him. This divine light, through repentance, will remove darkness and sin from the soul.\nJesus showed the light of brightness of his divinity to three of his apostles:\n“… Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John … and bringeth them up into an high mountain. …\n“And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.\n“While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.” (Matt. 17:1–2, 5.)\nOur Heavenly Father has commanded, “hear ye him.”\nJesus Christ was truly a God, living in a mortal body, with divine power; he was sent from heaven, to show mankind God’s way to celestial perfection.\nThe Lord’s ways and his thoughts are found in his scriptures.\nIn a parable, Jesus taught his disciples how they could partake of his life, his light and his power.\nHe said, “I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.\n“Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.\n“Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.\n“Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.\n“I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.\n“If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.\n“If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.\n“Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.\n“As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.\n“… even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love.\n“These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.” (John 15:1–11.)\nJesus Christ is the vine and all who sincerely want to become godlike, prepared to live with their Heavenly Father in his kingdom, must receive their strength and power from the Savior. No man cometh unto the Father but by and through Jesus Christ.\nThe nonproducing branches on the vine, some lost in the darkness and sin of the world, some weak and sick from the blight of evil, some branches fluttering in the winds of worldly pleasure and disrespect for the power to produce godlike fruit through the divine vine, having disrespect for Jesus Christ and for the Father and for their commandments, will be pruned from the vine. They will be cut away from their source of divine nourishment and their chance to become godlike. Pruned away from their divine opportunity, as a child of God, to partake of the light and divine way of life, their chance to live with God was foolishly dissipated away. They failed to feed on the living bread of life.\nAll of God’s children are branches on the vine; all have the opportunity to partake of the life, example, and commandments of Jesus Christ and to become like him.\nThe Lord also commanded man to build godlike perfection into his life. He said, “… I would that ye should be perfect even as I, or your Father who is in heaven is perfect.” (3 Ne. 12:48.)\nDivine perfection can only come through and by Jesus Christ, by knowing and following his ways, his truths, and his life. To be perfect we should be charitable, loving, honest, virtuous, upright, clean, and possess every godlike attribute. To become perfect, a child of God should live like a child of God. We can attain perfection by knowing and loving God with all our heart, and with all our soul, and with all our mind; and by loving our neighbors as ourselves. This leaves no love for the devil or for the darkness of the world.\nPerfection comes by seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness. Perfection comes by praying to a living God through a living Jesus Christ. Perfection comes by knowing and keeping all of God’s ways and commandments.\nThe Apostle Paul, as he counseled the saints to completely and fully accept the Lord, said:\n“Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.\n“Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.\n“For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.” (Eph. 6:10–12.)\nYes, we wrestle against the thoughts and ways of men that are contrary to the thoughts and ways of God.\nThe whole armor of God will keep the divine light of Jesus Christ inside and the darkness of evil outside. All who wear the full armor of God will be filled with pure love, happiness, peace, and godlike self-respect.\nIt is a blessing to have a living prophet and living apostles of the Lord to help us to know the higher thoughts and ways of the Lord and to encourage us to put on the whole armor of God and to be perfect even as our Father in heaven is perfect.\nMay we radiate from our countenance the light of life and walk as Jesus walked.\nIn the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "year": 1973,
        "content": "In one of the most beautiful prayers ever offered, the Savior invoked the blessings of the Father upon his apostles. He sensed his time was near when he must leave them. He prayed:\n“And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.\n“I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.\n“I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.” (John 17:11, 14–15.)\nThe members of the Church are constantly being reminded that even though they are “in the world, they should not be of the world.”\nWhat do we mean by the “world”? President McKay refers to it as those “… alienated from the Saints of God. They are aliens to the Church, and it is the spirit of this alienation that we should keep ourselves free from.” ( October 1911, p. 58.) Elder Bruce R. McConkie defines the “world” as “the social conditions created by such of the inhabitants of the earth as live carnal, sensuous, lustful lives, and who have not put off the natural man by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel.” (Bruce R. McConkie, [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966], p. 847.)\nJohn, in his epistle, describes the “world” as “the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life.” (1 Jn. 2:16.) He said:\n“Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\n“For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.\n“And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.” (1 Jn. 2:15–17.)\nIt is obvious the “world,” as referred to by the Savior, does not mean the sphere on which we live, but an environment created by individuals who live contrary to his teachings.\nJust as the Savior prayed that his apostles not be taken out of the world, but kept from the evil of the world, so are members of the Church everywhere praying that by the power of the Holy Ghost and the priesthood they may be strengthened to withstand the “world.”\nWe would not want to be free of our responsibility of being in the world by being taken out of the world, for this life is a probationary state. The “world” is our opportunity to prove ourselves. This is a part of the great plan of the Lord, to be confronted with the things of the “world,” that we might overcome them and be strengthened.\nAs the Lord showed Abraham the creation of the earth, he said: “… We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;\n“And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.” (Abr. 3:24–25.)\nIt is important that each of us overcome the “world.” “That every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to futurity, according to the moral agency which I have given unto him, that every man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment,” says the Lord. (D&C 101:78.)\nLehi taught, “For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so, … righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad. …” (2 Ne. 2:11.)\nIt matters not what our nationality, our race, our culture, our academic degree, or our political or social standing. We build security and strength in our lives by living the gospel. President Joseph Fielding Smith said: “And there is no cure for the ills of the world except the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Our hope for peace, for temporal and spiritual prosperity, and for an eventual inheritance in the kingdom of God is found only in and through the restored gospel.” (“Counsel to the Saints and to the World,” Joseph Fielding Smith, July 1972, p. 27.)\nMay I say to members of the Church everywhere, this is how we establish Zion where we live, by living the gospel, by being pure in heart, by being worthy.\nZion is defined by the Lord as the “pure in heart.” The Lord said, “… let Zion rejoice, for this is Zion—the pure in heart; therefore, let Zion rejoice, while all the wicked shall mourn.” (D&C 97:21.)\nSince Zion is defined as the “pure in heart,” those who make up Zion must be free from worldly practices and indulgences.\nPresident Lee said to us in last April conference that “The rule by which the people of God must live in order to be worthy of acceptance in the sight of God” is indicated in this scripture: “For Zion must increase in beauty, and in holiness; her borders must be enlarged; her stakes must be strengthened; yea, verily I say unto you, Zion must arise and put on her beautiful garments.” (D&C 82:14.) (“Strengthen the Stakes of Zion,” Harold B. Lee, July 1973, p. 3.)\nPresident McKay referred to Zion as the pure in heart and said: “… the strength of this Church lies in the purity of the thoughts and lives of its members, then the testimony of Jesus abides in the soul, and strength comes to each individual to withstand the evils of the world.” ( October 1911, p. 58.)\nThe righteous lives of members of the Church throughout the world is a great leaven to the gospel loaf. There are many wonderful, honest men and women in the world whose lives are influenced by the teachings of the gospel, as seen in the virtuous lives of good members of the Church.\nEverything in the world is not evil. There are many things of virtue, many great men and women working for the finer things of life, who have high standards and live righteously. Possibly a good definition of the world would be: “Exposure to things about us, whether good or bad—right or wrong.”\nPresident Lee said on one occasion to the youth of the Church: “We don’t pray that you may be withdrawn into a ‘Shangri-la’ away from the evils of the world, because you are to be a leaven wherever you are, to bring about righteousness, but we are pleading with the Lord with all our might that while you are in the world, you may be kept from evil.” (Harold B. Lee, [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1973], p. 223.)\nThere is a great challenge in living in the “world.” The concern is not where we live—but how we live. Obedience to the laws of the Lord will bring happiness and peace. We never need apologize for living the standards of the Church. Listen to two stalwart members of the Church who have proven this in their lives.\nJohn K. Edmunds, now president of the Salt Lake Temple, was an outstanding attorney in Chicago for over a quarter of a century. He said, “During all my years in Chicago, I have never felt the necessity for indulging in alcohol, tobacco, tea, or coffee, nor have I ever served or kept these things in our home. And I have never felt the need to apologize for the observance of our church standards. …\n“I have found no magic formula for keeping the standards of the Church. To me the observance of these standards is a matter of the will. … God gives to every man and woman, to every boy and girl who sincerely desire it the power to keep his commandments. …” (“Living in the World without Being a Part of the World,” John K. Edmunds, November 1965, p. 1053.)\nDe Witt J. Paul, who is now serving as a mission president in California and who was an executive of one of the nation’s largest financial institutions, states:\n“… Adhering to gospel standards has never stood in my way. Quite to the contrary, doing so has been an asset rather than a liability. Moreover, it has not been difficult or embarrassing.\n“In a world of rather wishy-washy convictions, one who believes in something and lives in accordance with his beliefs is usually admired and respected. I never appreciated this so much as when the chairman of the board of directors of my company one day said to the board members: ‘I am retiring, and I propose Mr. Paul as my successor. As you know, Mr. Paul is a Mormon. Mormons have rather high standards to live by, and among other things they do not smoke or drink. I have kept an eye on this fellow for many years now, and never once have I seen him make a slip. I recommend him to you as a man of integrity. …’\n“It is my experience that there are a lot of very fine people in the world. Just because they do not have my outlook on life has never given me reason to alienate them through prudish self-righteousness. Perhaps herein lies the secret of ‘living in the world without being a part of the world.’” (“Living in the World without Being a Part of the World,” De Witt J. Paul, September 1965, p. 838.)\nWe are living in the most glorious time since the creation of the world. Never before has man been able to do so many remarkable things, see and know so much of the world, have so many conveniences, enjoy so many luxuries.\nWe are living in the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times, in which the Lord has said: “… in the which I will gather together in one all things, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth.” (D&C 27:13.)\nHe said further, “For I deign to reveal unto my church things which have been kept hid from before the foundation of the world, things that pertain to the dispensation of the fulness of times.” (D&C 124:41.)\nThe prophet Joel prophesied of the times in which we live when he said, “And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:\n“And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit. And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth. …” (Joel 2:28–30.)\nThe Lord has already commenced to pour out his spirit upon all flesh. Since the restoration of the gospel, the Spirit of the Lord has inspired men in the world to accomplish things almost unbelievable to those who behold them. We are able to travel all over the world at incredible speed. Inventions too numerous to mention bless the lives of the inhabitants of the world.\nPresident Wilford Woodruff described this day when he said, “The day has already dawned when the light of heaven is to fill the earth; the day in which the Lord has said that nothing should be kept hidden, … the day in which everything that has been kept from the knowledge of man ever since the foundation of the earth, must be revealed; … It is a day in which the gospel is to be preached to every nation, tongue and people for a witness of what shall follow. …” ( vol. 24, p. 51.)\nThe Prophet Joseph wrote an editorial in the in May 1842 regarding the purpose of the Church in which he indicated the great joy of living in this day:\n“The building up of Zion is a cause that has interested the people of God in every age; it is a theme upon which prophets, priests, and kings have dwelt with peculiar delight; they have looked forward with joyful anticipation to the day in which we lived; and fired with heavenly and joyful anticipations, they have sung, and wrote, and prophesied of this our day;—but they died without the sight. …” ( vol. 3, p. 776.)\nMay we appreciate the privilege that is ours in living in this time, in the beautiful, wonderful world in which we live. May we let the gospel light guide us that we may be in the world and yet not partake of the evil of the world. I so ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "Thirty-four gifted and inspired speakers have preceded me, and now on this autumn day I feel like the last leaf on the tree as I say a few words before President Lee gives his final counsel and blessing. It is not a new experience for me to speak immediately preceding President Lee. I have had that privilege a score of times recently. Each time I have felt like the freshman team before the varsity comes out for the big game.\nBut I regard this as a great opportunity to add my testimony. I humbly seek the direction of the Holy Spirit as I speak upon a sacred theme.\nWe have sung in this conference a marvelous hymn, a hymn we have sung in conferences for more than a century: “We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet.” It is distinctive with us. As a people we sing some hymns that have come from other churches, and others sing some of ours. But only we can properly sing, “We thank thee, O God, for a prophet to guide us in these latter days.”\nIt was written more than a century ago by a man of humble circumstances who lived in Sheffield, England. He worked in the steel mills and was discharged because he joined the Mormon Church. But there burned in his heart a great and fervent testimony; and out of an overflowing spirit of gratitude, he penned these marvelous lines. They have become a grateful expression of appreciation for millions over the earth. I myself have heard them sung in 21 different languages as a reverent prayer of thanksgiving for divine revelation.\nHow thankful we ought to be, my brethren and sisters, how thankful we are, for a prophet to counsel us in words of divine wisdom as we walk our paths in these complex and difficult times. The solid assurance we carry in our hearts, the conviction that God will make his will known to his children through his recognized servant is the real basis of our faith and activity. We either have a prophet or we have nothing; and having a prophet, we have everything.\nTwelve years ago, in company with the mission president from Hong Kong, it was my opportunity to initiate the work in the Philippines. On April 28, 1961, we held a meeting that will never be forgotten by those of us who were present. We had no hall then in which to meet. We made a request of the United States Embassy for permission to meet on the beautiful porch of the marble memorial in the American military cemetery at Fort McKinley on the outskirts of Manila. We convened at 6:30 in the morning. In that hallowed and sacred place, where are remembered the tragedies of war, we commenced the work of teaching the gospel of peace.\nWe called upon the only native Filipino member we had been able to locate. He recounted a story which I have never forgotten.\nWhen he was a boy he found in a garbage can an old tattered copy of the It contained a condensation of a book giving the story of the Mormon people. It spoke of Joseph Smith and described him as a prophet. The word prophet did something to that boy. Could there actually be a prophet upon the earth? he wondered. The magazine was lost, but concern over the presence of a living prophet never left him during the long, dark years of war and oppression when the Philippines were occupied. Finally the forces of liberation came, and with them the reopening of Clark Air Base. David Lagman found employment there. His supervisor, he learned, was a Mormon, an Air Force officer. He wanted to ask him if he believed in a prophet, but was afraid to do so. Finally, after much inner turmoil, he mustered the courage to inquire.\n“Are you a Mormon, sir?” the young man asked. “Yes, I am,” was the forthright reply. “Do you believe in a prophet, do you have a prophet in your church?” came the anxious question.\n“We do have a prophet, a living prophet, who presides in this church and who teaches the will of the Lord.”\nDavid asked the officer to tell him more, and out of that teaching came his baptism. He was the first native elder ordained in the Philippines and today serves as president of the Northern Luzon District of the Church, now knowing for himself that there is indeed a living prophet on the earth.\nCould any people have a greater blessing than to have standing at their head one who receives and teaches the will of God concerning them? We need not look far in the world to know that “the wisdom of the wise has perished and that the understanding of the prudent has come to naught.” That wisdom for which the world should seek is the wisdom which comes from God. The only understanding that will save the world is divine understanding.\n“Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.” (Amos 3:7.)\nIt was so in the days of Amos and in all the years when holy men of God spake as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost. (See 2 Pet. 1:21.) Those ancient prophets warned not only of things to come, but more importantly, they became the revealers of truth to people. It was they who pointed the way men should live if they were to be happy and find peace in their lives.\nI think today of a young man I know who, as a Christian, trying one church after another, could find none that taught of a prophet. Only among the Jewish people did he find reverent mention of the prophets, and so he accepted and embraced the Jewish religion.\nIn the summer of 1964, he went to New York City and visited the World’s Fair. He entered the Mormon Pavilion and saw pictures of the prophets of the Old Testament. His heart warmed within him as he heard the missionaries speak with appreciation of these great men of ages past through whom Jehovah revealed his will. Then, as he progressed through the pavilion, he heard of modern prophets—of Joseph Smith who was called a prophet, a seer, and a revelator. Something stirred within him. His spirit responded to the testimony of the missionaries. He was baptized. He served a mission in South America where he had many converts. He returned home and has since become the means of bringing his family and others into the Church. It is heartwarming to hear him testify that Joseph Smith was indeed a prophet of God and that all who have succeeded him have been legal successors in this high and sacred calling.\nCould anyone, willing to read without bias the story of Joseph Smith, doubt that he was a great foreteller of events to come? Nearly thirty years before a shot was fired, he foretold the tragic American Civil War and stated that following that, war would be poured out upon all nations. You and I of this generation are witnesses to the fulfillment of those remarkable words.\nHe foretold that this people, then living in Illinois, would be driven out, would suffer much affliction, and would become a great and mighty people in the midst of the Rocky Mountains. Our presence today in this great Tabernacle on Temple Square in Salt Lake City is evidence of the fulfillment of those marvelous words of prophecy.\nIt has been so with his successors. On a cold winter day in 1849, when our forebears in this valley were hungry and living on sego roots and thistle tops, while gold was being found in California, Brigham Young stood in the old bowery on this square and spoke prophetic words to those who felt they might leave the hardships of life here to go to greener pastures in California. Among other things, he said:\n“We have been kicked out of the frying pan into the fire, out of the fire into the middle of the floor, and here we are and here we will stay. …\n“We shall build a city and a temple to the Most High God in this place. We will extend our settlements to the east and the west, to the north and south, and we will build towns and cities by the hundreds, and thousands of saints will gather in from the nations of the earth.\n“This will become the great highway of the nations. Kings and emperors and the noble and the wise of the earth will visit us here. …”\nHow could anyone stand in the Visitors Center to the north of us and witness the hundreds of thousands, yes, the millions, who come each year to visit us, and have any doubt that Brigham Young spoke other than as a prophet? Over the years there has been a veritable parade of notables who have found their way to the office of the First Presidency, there to meet particularly the man whom we sustain as the president of the Church and as the prophet of our day. They include leaders in the governments of the earth, in business and commerce, in education, in the professions. These are among “the noble and the wise of the earth” of whom Brigham Young spoke when we were an outcast people, isolated in a mountain wilderness.\nTwo weeks ago we were riding a plane from San Francisco to Sydney, Australia. We noted a young man in a nearby seat reading the book When opportunity presented itself, I spoke to him. I told him that I had read the book, that I had known the author, and asked him what his interest was. He said, among other things, that he had an interest in prophets and that this matter of a possible modern prophet had intrigued him. He had picked up the book at the library. We had a lengthy conversation in which I bore my witness that Joseph Smith was indeed a prophet. Not only did he speak of things to come, but more importantly, he was a revealer of eternal truth and a testifier of the divine mission of the Lord Jesus Christ. I am hopeful that that young man, as he continues his studies, will have come into his heart a similar testimony. I feel confident that he will.\nI am profoundly grateful, my brethren and sisters, not only for Joseph Smith as the prophet who served as an instrument in the hands of the Almighty in restoring this work, but also for all of those who have followed him. A study of their lives will reveal the manner in which the Lord has chosen them, has refined them, and has molded them to his eternal purposes. Joseph Smith declared on one occasion: “I am like a huge, rough stone rolling down from a high mountain; … with all hell knocking off a corner here and a corner there, and thus I will become a smooth and polished shaft in the quiver of the Almighty.”\nHe was hated and persecuted. He was driven and imprisoned. He was abused and beaten. And as you read his history, you see the evolution of which he spoke. There developed a power in his life. There came a refinement. There grew a love for others which even overcame his own love for life. The corners of that rough stone were knocked off, and he became a polished shaft in the hand of the Almighty.\nIt has been so with those who have succeeded him. Through long years of dedicated service, they have been refined and winnowed and chastened and molded for the purposes of the Almighty. Could anyone doubt this after reading the lives of such men as Brigham Young, Wilford Woodruff, and Joseph F. Smith? The Lord subdued their hearts and refined their natures to prepare them for the great and sacred responsibility later thrust upon them. It has been so with him who stands as President of the Church today, our beloved leader, President Harold B. Lee. I hope he will pardon me. I do not wish to embarrass him. But can one who knows something of his life deny the same influences at work? He came out of circumstances that would today be classed as poverty. From firsthand experience he knows the meaning of hard manual labor. He served as a missionary and was rejected by most of those upon whom he called. He sacrificed for an education. He has known serious illness when life seemed to hang by a thread. He has walked through deep and dark valleys of sorrow. Looking back upon the history of his life, it all appears to be part of a pattern, a refining process that he might better understand the trials, the afflictions, the sorrows of others. And yet, with all of this, there is a great buoyancy of spirit that rises above the tragic and the sorrowful and lifts to higher ground all of those he touches and influences.\nAs one who recently walked with him as a junior companion in the missions of Europe and England, I have seen young people eagerly press about him with tears in their eyes and smiles, sweet and beautiful, upon their faces. I have seen missionaries sit enraptured as he taught from the scriptures, speaking, like the Master, “as one having authority.” I have seen little children sit almost motionless as he spoke their language and led them to understand sacred truths of the sacrament. I have seen elderly men and women weep as he blessed them.\nI have seen few things more touching than a strong young man embracing the President and then later with tear-moistened eyes saying, “Never have I been so near to heaven.”\nAs one to whom the spirit has borne witness, I testify of his prophetic calling, and add my voice to the voices of our people over the earth, “We thank thee, O God, for a prophet to guide us in these latter days.” I am grateful. I am satisfied that the peace and the progress and the prosperity of this people lie in doing the will of the Lord as that will is articulated by him who shall speak to us as we close this great conference. If we fail to observe his counsel, we repudiate his sacred calling. If we abide his counsel, we shall be blessed of God.\n\nWe ever pray for thee, our Prophet dear,\nThat God will give to thee comfort and cheer;\nAs the advancing years furrow thy brow,\nStill may the light within shine bright as now. …\n\n— no. 386\n\nGod lives and is a revealer of eternal truth. Jesus Christ is our Savior and stands at the head of this Church. We have a prophet upon the earth, a seer and a revelator to teach us. God give us the faith and the discipline within ourselves to follow that teaching, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."

        "content": "If the Lord will give me utterance, there are a few things I should like to say to you. We have members of the Church in all parts of the world. One of the anxious centers right today is over in Israel, where a war is raging. As yet we don’t know very much about the extent of it, but it seems that Egypt and Syria are moving into areas of Israel.\nWe have a number of our BYU students there, and also we have a branch of the Church organized in Jerusalem. We have had anxious parents who have been wondering, watching, waiting. The word has come to us that they are all safe and they are being watched over. You can be sure that we have shepherds of the flock, and we will continue to pray with you that no harm will come to any of them.\nThere has been turmoil down in Chile, where we have thousands of members of the Church and almost two hundred missionaries. The word comes to us, from one of the presiding authorities who has been here from Santiago, that there has been no loss of life as far as we know. Our people are holding fast, not taking part in the political turmoil, rising above it, as true members of the Church of Jesus Christ are expected to do, giving allegiance to those who are in command, and not wishing to take sides, but merely to bow their heads and yield obedience to the authority of the government where they are.\nWe pray for our Saints everywhere, pray that they will hold steadfast. But, some of the greatest of our enemies are those within our own ranks. It was the lament of the Master, as he witnessed one of those chosen men, who under inspiration he chose as one of the Twelve, betray him with a kiss and for a few paltry pieces of silver turn him over to his enemies. Judas then stood by and, realizing the enormity of what he had done, took the only escape out to sacrifice himself. And Jesus could only explain that of the Twelve, meaning Judas, he had a devil.\nWhen we see some of our own today doing similar things, some who have been recognized and honored in the past as teachers and leaders who later fall by the wayside, our hearts are made sore and tender. But sometimes we have to say just like the Master said, “The devil must have entered into them.”\nA few years ago, we had a woman who had written some scurrilous things about the Prophet Joseph Smith. (Mention was made of it here in the conference at that time.) Shortly thereafter, I met someone on the street and they asked me if there had been a revelation or an utterance at the recently concluded general conference that might be considered as a prophecy. And I said, “Did you hear the closing remarks of President George Albert Smith as he closed the conference? If you did, you heard a prophet speaking, and let me tell you what he said.” I happened to have a clipping in my wallet. This is what President George Albert Smith said:\n“Many have belittled Joseph Smith, but those who have will be forgotten in the remains of mother earth, and the odor of their infamy will ever be with them, but honor, majesty, and fidelity to God, exemplified by Joseph Smith and attached to his name, will never die.”\nNo truer words were ever spoken, and that person fell just as all others will fall who try to tear down the work of the Lord.\nWe have had some who, writing in the public press occasionally, are among those who have fallen by the wayside. They befoul the honored family names that they have. They have disgraced the honors that we had given to them in times past. They are trying to join the forces of the enemy against the work of the Lord. And we can say to them, as President George Albert Smith said then, “Those who have will be forgotten in the remains of mother earth, and the odor of the infamy will ever be with them, but honor, majesty, and fidelity to God, exemplified by the leaders of this church and attached to their names, will never die.”\nI always remember the word of the Lord when I hear these things said by those who are trying to tear down his work. The Lord has said:\n“Wherefore, confound your enemies; call upon them to meet you both in public and in private; …\n“Wherefore, let them bring forth their strong reasons against the Lord.\n“Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you—there is no weapon that is formed against you, shall prosper;\n“And if any man lift his voice against you he shall be confounded in mine own due time.\n“Wherefore, keep my commandments. …” (D&C 71:7–11.)\nWhat he is trying to have us understand is that he will take care of our enemies if we continue to keep the commandments. So, you Saints of the Most High God, when these things come, and they will come—this has been prophesied—you just say,\n“No weapon formed against the work of the Lord will ever prosper, but all glory and majesty of this work that the Lord gave will long be remembered after those who have tried to befoul the name of the Church and those of its leaders will be forgotten, and their works will follow after them.”\nWe feel sorry for them when we see these things happen.\nNow, one thing more I should like to say. I am sure that many people came to this conference with many questions on their minds, seeking to know the answers to some of the troublesome things about them, wanting to know what to do in this case or in that case, how to act under these circumstances. As we have listened to their questions, we have remembered what the Lord said here in the preface to the revelations. He said:\n“And the arm of the Lord shall be revealed; and the day cometh that they who will not hear the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his servants, neither give heed to the words of the prophets and apostles, shall be cut off from among the people.” And then he continued, “What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.” (D&C 1:14, 38.)\nIn another great revelation he explained something else that we would have the Saints remember today. Where are you going to go to hear and find out what the Lord wants you to do today? The Lord declared again:\n“And this is the ensample unto them [he is talking now to those who are leaders of the Church], that they shall speak as they are moved upon by the Holy Ghost.\n“And whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall be scripture, shall be the will of the Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord, shall be the voice of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation.” (D&C 68:3–4.)\nTo the Twelve shortly after the organization of the Church, he said something else that I would like you to remember before I draw one or two conclusions from what the Lord has told us. The Lord here is talking about the revelations that had been compiled up to that time in the Doctrine and Covenants.\nFirst may I quote something that the Prophet Joseph Smith said about the Book of Mormon: “I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.” ( vol. 4, p. 461.) And then he added, “If we didn’t have the Book of Mormon and the revelations of God, we would have nothing.” (See vol. 2, p. 52.)\nIt is that foundation upon which the Church and kingdom of God is built in our day; and so with respect to these revelations the Lord said this, as may be found in the eighteenth section of the Doctrine and Covenants:\n“And now I speak unto you, the Twelve—Behold my grace is sufficient for you; you must walk uprightly before me and sin not.\n\n“And I, Jesus Christ, your Lord and your God, have spoken it.\n“These words [meaning the revelations] are not of men nor of man, but of me; wherefore, you shall testify they are of me and not of man;\n“For it is my voice which speaketh them unto you; for they are given by my Spirit unto you, and by my power you can read them one to another; and save it were by my power you could not have them.” (D&C 18:31, 33–35.)\nAnd then he added this: “Wherefore, you can testify [meaning that one stands in the pulpit and reads from these revelations] that you have heard my voice, and know my words.” (D&C 18:36.) For as I have already quoted, he said, “… whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.” (D&C 1:38.)\nNow, you Latter-day Saints, I think you have never attended a conference where in these three days you have heard more inspired declarations on most every subject and problem about which you have been worrying. If you want to know what the Lord would have the Saints know and to have his guidance and direction for the next six months, get a copy of the proceedings of this conference, and you will have the latest word of the Lord as far as the Saints are concerned. And [also] all others who are not of us, but who believe what has been said has been the mind of the Lord, the will of the Lord, and the voice of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation. (See D&C 68:4.)\nAs I say, realizing that is a very bold statement to make, I have thought of a great revelation where the Lord said something about the creation of the universe. In the eighty-eighth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord said:\n“The earth rolls upon her wings, and the sun giveth his light by day, and the moon giveth her light by night, and the stars also give their light, as they roll upon their wings in their glory, in the midst of the power of God.\n“Unto what shall I liken these kingdoms, that ye may understand?\n“Behold, all these are kingdoms, and any man who hath seen any or the least of these hath seen God moving in his majesty and power.” (D&C 88:45–47.)\nLikewise I say to you, as I stand with you and see the moving hand of the Lord in the affairs of the nations of the world today, we are seeing the signs of our times as foretold by the prophets and by the Master himself, and we see what is happening and the things transpiring before us in our day. In the Church, we have been witnessing some of the most dramatic things, and I can testify that you are seeing what the Lord is revealing for the needs of this people today.\nMay I paraphrase what the Lord has said in this great revelation from which I have quoted: any man who has seen any of the least of these happenings among us today, has seen God today moving in his majesty and in his power. Let us make no mistake about that.\nWhere else can you go for guidance? Where is there safety in the world today? Safety can’t be won by tanks and guns and the airplanes and atomic bombs. There is only one place of safety and that is within the realm of the power of Almighty God that he gives to those who keep his commandments and listen to his voice, as he speaks through the channels that he has ordained for that purpose.\nIn the answer that he gave to his disciples, when he told them that he was coming again, he explained some important things to them. The disciples asked him, “… Tell us, when shall these things be and the end of the world or the destruction of the wicked, which is the end of the world?” (See Matt. 24:3.) In their question, you have the definition of what it means to say “the end of the world.”\nAnd then he gave to his disciples what we read in the twenty-fourth chapter of the Book of Matthew, what may be better understood from the Inspired Version, which is found in the Pearl of Great Price. He said, when the fig tree “begins to put forth leaves, you know that summer is nigh at hand.” (JS—M 1:39.)\nHe gave them certain signs by which they might know that his coming was nigh, even at their very doors. There will be great tribulation upon the Jews and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, “such as was not before sent upon Israel, of God, since the beginning of their kingdom until this time; no, nor ever shall be sent again upon Israel.” (JS—M 1:18.)\n“And except those days should be shortened, there should none of their flesh be saved; but for the elect’s sake, according to the covenant, those days shall be shortened.\n“Behold, these things I have spoken unto you concerning the Jews; and again, after the tribulations of those days which shall come upon Jerusalem, if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there, believe him not;\n“For in those days there shall also arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders, insomuch, that, if possible, they shall deceive the very elect, who are the elect according to the covenant.” [That means the members of this Church.]\n“Wherefore, if they shall say unto you: Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth; Behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not;\n“For as the light of the morning cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west, … so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be.” (JS—M 1:20–22, 25–26.)\nThen he speaks of the wars that shall come: “… for nations shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.\n“And again, because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold; but he that shall not be overcome, the same shall be saved.\n“And again, this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world, for a witness unto all nations, and then shall the end come, or the destruction of the wicked;\n“And immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven shall be shaken.\n“Verily, I say unto you, this generation, in which these things shall be shown forth, shall not pass away until all I have told you shall be fulfilled.\n\n“But of that day, and hour, no one knoweth; no, not the angels of God in heaven, but my Father only.\n“But as it was in the days of Noah, so it shall be also at the coming of the Son of Man;\n“For it shall be with them, as it was in the days which were before the flood; for until the day that Noah entered into the ark they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage;\n“And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be.\n“Then shall be fulfilled that which is written, that in the last days, two shall be in the field, the one shall be taken, and the other left;\n“Two shall be grinding at the mill, the one shall be taken, and the other left;\n“And what I say unto one, I say unto all men; watch, therefore, for you know not at what hour your Lord doth come.\n“Therefore be ye also ready, for in such an hour as ye think not, the Son of Man cometh.” (JS—M 1:29–31, 33–34, 40–46.)\nBrothers and sisters, this is the day the Lord is speaking of. You see the signs are here. Be ye therefore ready. The Brethren have told you in this conference how to prepare to be ready. We have never had a conference where there has been so much direct instruction, so much admonition; when the problems have been defined and also the solution to the problem has been suggested.\nLet us not turn a deaf ear now, but listen to these as the words that have come from the Lord, inspired of him, and we will be safe on Zion’s hill, until all that the Lord has for his children shall have been accomplished.\nAnd so, in the closing moments of this conference, I have been moved as I think I have never been moved before in all my life. If it were not for the assurance that I have that the Lord is near to us, guiding, directing, the burden would be almost beyond my strength, but because I know that he is there, and that he can be appealed to, and if we have ears to hear attuned to him, we will never be left alone.\nI am grateful for strong men like President Tanner and President Romney and the Twelve and all the General Authorities, who are united more so than I have ever experienced before during my lifetime. The General Authorities are united and working together and are speaking with one voice to the world.\nFollow the Brethren, listen to the Brethren. I bear you my witness as one whom the Lord has brought to this place, as Brother Gordon Hinckley has said. I thank the Lord that I may have passed some of the tests, but maybe there will have to be more before I shall have been polished to do all that the Lord would have me do.\nSometimes when the veil has been very thin, I have thought that if the struggle had been still greater that maybe then there would have been no veil. I stand by, not asking for anything more than the Lord wants to give me, but I know that he is up there and he is guiding and directing.\nI extend my blessings to you wonderful Saints. Go back to your homes now. Take the love of the General Authorities to your people. We extend to those who are not members of the Church the hand of fellowship. May we reach out to those who have lost their sense of direction and, before it is too late, try to win them back into the fold; because they are all God’s children, and he wants us to save all of them.\nPeace be with you, not the peace that comes from the legislation in the halls of congress, but the peace that comes in the way that the Master said, by overcoming all the things of the world. That God may help us so to understand and may you know that I know with a certainty that defies all doubt that this is his work, that he is guiding us and directing us today, as he has done in every dispensation of the gospel, and I say that with all the humility of my soul, in the name of the Lord, Jesus Christ. Amen."
